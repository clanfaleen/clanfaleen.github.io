                         -------------------------

Important Policy Note



Implementation

As of 9/11/95, all of the spells in this circle are implemented except for
208, 217, 218, 220, and 250.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

201  Calm               Duration: 1 minute per level                  CALM

   Under the influence of this spell, the target person or creature is
   soothed and calmed, inhibiting them from engaging in aggressive behavior.
   Actions involving combat or the casting of spells are not possible while
   in the calmed state.

   NOTE:  The target of this spell receives a spirit warding to avoid the
   effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

202  Spirit Shield      Duration: 1 Minute per level                SSHIELD

   The caster uses his or her Spiritual powers to influence the surrounding
   Spirits to provide additional physical protection to the target of
   the spell.

   NOTE:  The spell provides an additional +10 to Physical DS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

203  Manna                                                            MANNA

   Through the use of this spell, the caster calls into being special food
   with potent qualities.  Persons who partake of the magically created
   food, and then take time to rest and relax will experience accelerated
   healing and accelerated mana point recovery.

   NOTE:  Food created by this spell loses its potency quickly unless it
   is specially preserved.  As the food deteriorates, it may actually
   become poisonous.  The caster creates one mouthful of the special food
   for each level of experience.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

204  Unpresence         Duration:  1 minute per level            UNPRESENCE

   Through this spell, spiritual forces are invoked to protect the target of
   the spell from many magical means of location.  While persons with this
   spell in effect on them will not find it any easier to initially conceal
   themselves in a hiding place, they will find that it improves their
   ability to remain hidden when others search for them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

205  Light              Duration: 1 minute per level                  LIGHT

   The spiritual forces are used to invoke the Spirits of Light, influencing
   them to provide greater illumination in the immediate area where the spell
   is cast.  The additional illumination may make possible actions that could
   not be performed in darkness, and may enhance the combat ability of
   everyone in the illuminated area.  The sudden illumination of an otherwise
   dark area may reveal hidden persons or creatures.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

206  Darkness           Duration: 1 minute per level               DARKNESS

   Being similar to the Light spell, this spell invokes the Spirits of
   Shadow and Darkness to dim the illumination in the immediate area where
   the spell is cast.  Combat conducted in a darkened area is done so with
   reduced abilities.  Some actions that require good illumination may not
   be possible in a darkened area.  People may find it easier to hide and
   remain hidden in darkened areas.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

207  Purify Air        Duration: 1 minute per level               PURIFYAIR

   This potent manipulation of spiritual forces that lie within each of us
   bolsters the ability of the target person to withstand the ravages of a
   hostile environment.  The effect gives enhanced warding against gaseous
   poisons, in some circumstances allows the person to actually breathe
   underwater, and according to some reports has allowed persons to survive
   in total vacuum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

208  Living Spell                                                 LIVESPELL

   This spell enables the caster to transfer a prepared spell from another
   person.  Transfer of the spell is one way only, from the target to the
   caster.  The target person will lose mana points as if they had cast
   the spell being transferred.  The caster who receives the spell will also
   have to expend mana points when casting the spell that has been
   transferred.

   NOTE:  The caster will meet some resistance when attempting to transfer
   a spell that they do not actually know.  The amount of resistance met
   will vary in difficulty depending on whether the spell is from the
   caster's own circle, a major or minor circle available to the caster, or 
   some other circle not available to the caster.  Both the caster and target
   risk suffering damage if the transfer of a spell fails.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

209  Untrammel                                                    UNTRAMMEL

   By channeling his or her will, the caster is able to use this spell to
   dissolve the webs cast by both natural and magical spiders of all sizes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

210  Silence            Duration: 5 seconds per level               SILENCE

   Through the spiritual forces, the caster is able to influence the
   Spirits of Sound to place a pall of silence over the target of this
   spell.  The target person or creature will be unable to speak, sing,
   or prepare or cast a spell.

   NOTE:  The target of the spell receives a Spirit warding to avoid the
   effects of the spell.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

211  Bravery            Duration: 1 minute per level                BRAVERY

   This spell enables the caster to draw upon the surrounding Lesser
   Spirits for additional courage and confidence in battle.  The caster's
   mental and physical fortitude is bolstered making them more effective
   in combat as well as strengthening their will against fearsome foes.

   NOTE:  Because of the unique and personal nature of this spell, it
   cannot be cast on others.  The caster realizes +15 to their Physical AS,
   and is afforded some protection against certain types of fear.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

212  Interference       Duration: 3 seconds per level             INTERFERE

   The caster of this spell is able to use the spiritual forces to exert
   influence over the Lesser Spirits in the immediate area to interfere with
   the actions of the target person or creature.  This interference results
   in diminished combat ability.

   NOTE:  The target of the spell receives a Spirit warding and if that roll
   is failed, suffers a -15 penalty to Physical AS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

213  Minor Sanctuary   Duration: 5 minutes plus 10 sec/level      MINRSANCT

   By mustering the power of the surrounding Lesser Spirits, the caster
   is able to employ this spell to create an area that is relatively safe
   from danger.  This increased security will allow both the Cleric and
   Empath to practice their profession in greater security.  While this
   spell is in effect, most creatures will avoid entering the area of the
   spell.  Persons or creatures that are in the area will not be able to
   hide from or steal from others.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

214  Bind               Duration: 5 sec per level                   BINDING

   The caster uses this spell to call upon the surrounding Lesser Spirits
   to hold the target person or creature immobile.

   NOTE:  The target of this spell receives a Spirit warding to avoid the
   effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

215  Heroism            Duration: 1 minute per level                HEROISM

   The caster of this spell is able to draw additional fortitude from the
   surrounding Lesser Spirits.  This serves to bolster the caster's courage
   and confidence, thus improving the caster's combat effectiveness.  The
   spell helps to bring the caster's mind and body into focus, allowing
   the caster to recover from both physical and mental fatigue at a faster
   rate.

   NOTE:  The unique and personal nature of this spell makes it impossible
   to be cast on another person or creature; the magic is effective on the
   caster only.  The caster will realize a +25 to Physical AS and increased
   health point and mana point recovery.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

216  Frenzy             Duration: 5 seconds per level                FRENZY

   The caster employs this spell to drive the target person or creature
   into an intense state of combat frenzy.  The target of the spell is
   influenced in a manner such that they will take no special action to
   defend themselves in combat.  Instead, the target creature or person will
   focus all of their available skill in a frantic attack.

   NOTE:  The target of this spell receives a spirit warding to avoid the
   effect of the spell.  Failure of that roll forces the target to take a
   fully offensive stance, where it will remain for the duration of the
   spell.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

217  Herb Mastery                                                  HERBMAST

   Wild herbs, fruits, and other plants can be found through the land of
   Elanthia.  Many of the naturally occurring plants have special properties
   when properly employed but are often useless, and in some cases actually
   dangerous, when employed by the unskilled.  This spell allows the caster
   to prepare many of the commonly found flora to bring out their natural
   efficacy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

218  Spirit Servant   Duration: 1 minute per level                  SERVANT

   Through the use of this powerful spell, the caster is able to manipulate
   the spiritual forces to bind a Lesser Spirit to their service for a
   short time.  The spirit bound in this manner takes on a corporeal
   existence by drawing on the very life force of the caster.  In this way,
   the bound spirit is able to manipulate small physical items and perform
   other simple tasks at the caster's behest.

   NOTE:  The caster of this spell does not actually lose Spirit Points at
   the time that this spell is cast.  The caster, in fact, will see no
   reduction of points at all if the Spirit Servant is released from service
   prior to the expiration of the spell.  If the spell duration expires
   before the caster releases the spirit from service, or the spirit meets
   with some other untimely end, then the caster will suffer a loss of four
   spirit points.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

219  Spell Shield       Duration: 1 minute per level               SPSHIELD

   Through the use of this spell, the caster is able to call upon the
   Spirits of Power to form a powerful barrier against magical attacks.

   NOTE:  This spell grants a +50 to spirit wardings as well as a -50
   to Elemental Attacks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

220  Major Sanctuary    Duration: 1 minute per level                MJSANCT

   This extremely powerful spell allows the caster to call into being a
   magical portal leading to a special place of safety.  The caster is
   able to call upon their special relationship with their patron Greater
   Spirit or Lord of Liabo to provide them with a place of refuge in which
   they may rest and practice their arts and skills in relative safety.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

225  Transference                                                  TRANSFER

   The caster of this spell is able to use the spiritual forces to
   transfer themselves to the physical location of the target individual.
   Transference of this type is effective on the caster only, and some
   magical or natural occurrences may prevent this spell from operating
   properly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

230  Spirit Hunter     Duration: 12 rounds                         SPHUNTER

   Through the use of spiritual forces and this spell, the caster is able to
   call forth a potent Lesser Spirit that will attach itself to the target
   of the spell and slowly drain the very life essence from that person
   or creature.  The Silent Slayer will plague the individual or creature
   for the duration of the spell, or until death occurs, whichever comes
   first.

   NOTE:  The target of this spell receives a Spirit warding to avoid the
   effect of the spell.  In some cases, after a particularly high warding
   result, the Silent Slayer will actually turn upon the caster.  When the
   Silent Slayer attaches itself to a person or a creature, it drains the
   spirit points from that person or creature at the rate of 1 points
   per 15-second round for a maximum of 12 rounds, or until death occurs.
