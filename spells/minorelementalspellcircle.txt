   Notes:

   Detecting a hidden or invisible character simply reveals that they are

   disclosed, therefore they remain hidden or invisible and the target
   character cannot direct actions against them.

405 Elemental Detection   Duration: Immediate                     ELEMDETECT

   When cast on a person or creature, this spell will reveal the nature of
   any spells that may currently be in effect.  When cast on an object, this
   spell will reveal the exact nature of any spell that may be stored in an
   object, such as a wand, or in the case of an enchanted weapon or armor,
   will reveal the plus of the object, or will indicate other special
   abilities of the object.

    Notes:

   The amount of information provided by this spell is directly related to
   the level of the caster.  The caster will not be able to identify spells
   of a higher level than his/her own level.  As the caster advances in
   level, more information regarding the nature of magical items will be
   revealed, including the number of charges in an item, the exact plus of
   weapons and armor, and other special qualities of items.  Some magicks
   are so potent or complicated as to be resistant to this spell.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Causes closed and/or locked containers or doors to pop open.

   Notes:

   The percentage chance of success is based on the aura of the caster
   and the caster's level.  An unsuccessful attempt to cast this spell has
   a chance to set off any trap that may be a part of the locking device.
   This spell is not enhanced by the use of Picking Enhancement.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

408 Disarm      Duration: Immediate                                   DISARM

   Causes a trap on a container or door to be disarmed.

   Notes:

   The percentage chance of success is based on the aura of the caster
   and the caster's level.  An unsuccessful attempt to cast this spell may
   set off any resident traps.  A successful cast on a trapped mechanism
   will provide positive indication that a trap has been disarmed, but a
   successful cast on a mechanism free of traps, or a failed cast will not
   necessarily reveal the presence of or lack of a trap.

   Notes:

   The target character or creature that fails a spirit warding is
   subjected to a crushing injury.  The severity of the injury is
   based on the degree of the spirit warding failure, and the difference in 
   levels between the caster and the target.

   wave that may result in knocking down all characters and creatures
   in the area.

   Notes:

   The wave moves outward from the caster and the caster has some limited
   control over the direction that the wave moves in.  All characters and
   creatures not joined to the same group as the caster must make a saving
   roll, or fall prone.

   magical or holy enchantments.  The exact nature of the special damage

   find that the spell imparts blasts of heat, others will impart blasts of
   cold, and others will impart blasts of electricity.

   When cast on an item, this spell has a chance to drain charges, dispel
   any stored spells, remove part or all of an enchantment, or remove
   some other special quality.

   Notes:

   The effect of casting on a character or creature is in order of precedent
   stated.  The chance of failure depends on the level of the caster and the
   level and type of stored spell or enchantment.

   This spell allows the caster to temporarily gather the local elemental
   forces, creating a small Mana Focus.
