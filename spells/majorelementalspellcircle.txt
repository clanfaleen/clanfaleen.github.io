Important Policy Note


Implementation

As of 4/5/94, spells 1-25 have been implemented.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

501  Sleep I                 Duration: 5 seconds/level                 SLEEP1

    A very relaxed feeling will overcome the target of this spell and
    dull its senses, possibly causing it to fall into a magically
    induced slumber.  The actual effect depends on how badly the creature
    fails its spiritual warding:


    If the spiritual warding fails by less than or equal to 10, the creature
    is only dazed by the spell (no useful affect, just a momentary pause). If
    the spiritual warding fails by less than or equal to 25, then the
    creature becomes very drowsy for 10 seconds.  Failure by any more than
    this will cause the creature to fall asleep (and fall over if
    appropriate).  Any loud noises or sudden actions can wake the creature.

    Creatures which do not normally sleep (such as the undead) are
    unaffected by this spell.

    Because this spell is weak in nature, it only works on creatures up
    to, and including, level 4.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

502  Spell Store             Duration: Special                     SPELLSTORE

    Often times the outcome of a battle is determined by who can react
    first.  Because the wizard often is hindered by lengthy gestures and
    chants, Spell Store has become an invaluable first strike weapon.
    After casting this spell, the caster can then cast any of his or her
    other spells which will stay prepared for an indefinite period of
    time. The spell to be stored must be cast within 30 seconds after
    Spell Store. Note that although spell store does hold a spell for a
    long time, it does not do so forever; the exact time when this fails
    depends on the caster's activity.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

503  Blur                    Duration: 60 seconds/level                  BLUR

    Although the logic behind this spell is quite simple, its effect is
    very potent.  With a few quick gestures, the caster can cause his or
    her image to become distorted and difficult to focus upon.  The
    result is that the wizard gains +10 to DS and thus is harder to hit in
    combat.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

504  Slow I                  Duration: 1 minute                         SLOW1

    This spell makes the air surrounding its victim viscous, effectively
    slowing down all of its actions.  The result is that the target's
    actions/round-times take three seconds longer than normal.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

505  Sleep II                Duration: 8 seconds/level                 SLEEP2


    This spell works as Sleep I (501) but is effective against higher
    level creatures up to level 12.  The exact effect depends on how
    badly the creature fails its spiritual warding:

    If the spiritual warding fails by less than or equal to 12, the creature
    is only dazed by the spell (no useful affect, just a momentary pause).
    If the spiritual warding fails by less than or equal to 29, then the
    creature becomes very drowsy for 10 seconds.  Failure by any more than
    this will cause the creature to fall asleep (and fall over if
    appropriate).  Any loud noises or sudden actions can wake the creature.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

506  Haste I                 Duration: 1 minute                        HASTE1

    In a not completely understood manner, invoking the magic of this
    spell distorts time around the target.  To the recipient, the world
    seems to slow down, allowing the recipient to react more quickly than
    naturally possible.  Fortunately, the power of the spell fuels the
    extra energy needed to operate at an accelerated rate.  The target's
    roundtime/actions will take three seconds less than normal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

507  Elemental Deflection    Duration: 20 seconds/level               DEFLECT

    Since it is not always possible to carry a shield, this spell can
    be a blessing.  This spell creates a minor shield around the body of the
    caster which has the affect of adding +20 to DS.  This shield does not
    affect spells, except elemental attacks.  The deflection is sometimes
    only enough to redirect how hard the blow hits.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
508  Elemental Bias         Duration: 30 seconds/level               ELEMBIAS

    Because Elemental Deflection offers limited spell defense, this spell
    can provide excellent additional protection.  It works like Elemental
    Deflection by creating an invisible minor shield around the caster,
    but this one works against non-elemental attack spells by adding
    +20 to spiritual warding.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
509  Strength               Duration: 30 seconds/level               STRENGTH

    An ancient spell which has long been a part of a wizard's spell book.
    The strength spell enables its recipient to better utilize his or her
    body and thus cause an apparent increase in strength.  This has the
    effect of adding +15 to the target's AS.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

510  Unpain                  Duration: 5 minutes                       UNPAIN

    While elemental spells do not normally deal with the healing arts, this
    one is an exception.  The unpain spell provides a temporary restoration
    of lost health points for the duration of the spell.  The target will get
    a maximum of 50 HPs for 5 minutes, the total not to exceed the max of the
    target.  These points will vanish when the spell ends.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

511  Floating Disk           Duration: Special                      FLOATDISK

    The floating disk spell, which is believed to be one of Melgorehn's
    inventions, creates an insubstantial disk that can be used to hold
    objects by the caster.  The disk will follow the caster around for
    the duration of the spell and allows for the temporary hauling of
    many objects from one place to another.  The caster is the only one
    able to OPEN or CLOSE the disk.

    The spell actually has an indefinite duration and will continue to
    exist until the player logs off or disconnects or some other
    situation breaks the magical 'thread' which binds the disk to the
    caster.  When this happens, the disk will vanish and the objects will
    fall to the ground.  Note that GemStone III will attempt to keep the
    disk around for awhile after a disconnect so that the caster can
    attempt to reconnect; this duration is only a a couple minutes so get
    back online fast.  We cannot be responsible for objects lost while
    being transported on a disk as this is a fragile and unpredictable
    system for object holding.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

512  Slow II                 Duration: 1 minute                         SLOW2

    This works as Slow I but increases the actions/round-times by 6
    seconds instead of 3.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 513  Sleep III               Duration: 10 seconds/level               SLEEP3

    This spell works as Sleep I (501) but is effective against higher
    level creatures up to level 18.  The exact effect depends on how
    badly the creature fails its spiritual warding:

    If the spiritual warding fails by less than or equal to 14, the creature
    is only dazed by the spell (no useful effect, just a momentary pause).
    If the spiritual warding fails by less than or equal to 33, then the
    creature becomes very drowsy for 10 seconds.  Failure by any more than
    this will cause the creature to fall asleep (and fall over if
    appropriate).  Any loud noises or sudden actions can wake the creature.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

514  Haste II                Duration: 1 minute                        HASTE2

    This spell works as Haste I but decreases actions/roundtimes by 6
    seconds instead of 3.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

515  Rapid Fire              Duration: 5 seconds/level              RAPIDFIRE

    This powerful spell is used to augment attack spells, in particular
    elemental attack spells.  Once cast, the next spell which is prepared
    will be prepared again once cast, automatically for the duration of
    the Rapid Fire spell.  Therefore once Rapid Fire is in effect, you may
    then prepare, for example, a Minor Fire spell and then continue to
    cast it with no preparation step (or time) in-between for as long as
    the Rapid Fire spell is in effect.  Note that to switch spells being
    used, use a RELEASE command and then PREPARE a new spell.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

516 DATELINE FEBRUARY 3th 1998:

Mana Leech Spell Discovered:

The Major Elemental Spell 516 has been changed from Life Leech to Mana Leech.  
Now when it is cast at a target, the caster will drain a random amount of mana 
from the target up to 1 mana per 3 warding failure.  The amount drained will 
never be more than 1 mana per level of the caster or more than the target has.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

517  Charge Item             Duration: Up to 15 minutes            CHARGEITEM

    This spell enables the caster to tap into the mana pool and redirect some
    of it into a magical focus.  This focus must be a specially treated gem
    of at least 1000 silvers in value.  By casting this spell at the treated
    gem, the focus will be created and begin to accumulate the mana.  The
    wizard must then concentrate completely and continue to cast the spell
    until the gem has become sufficiently charged. (Note that this only costs
    1 mana point after the initial cast.) At this point, energy from it can
    be directed into the desired item.  The chance of success is based on the
    caster's level, and the level of the spell. Extraordinary failure has
    been known to result in loss of mana points, injury to the wizard, and
    even destruction of the item.  The mana cost to recharge an item is 1
    mana point per charge times the level of the spell being recharged.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

518  Cone of Lightning       Duration: Instantaneous               CONEOLIGHT

    While Major Shock is quite powerful, it still is not a suitable defense
    against multiple opponents.  Because of this, the Cone of Lightning spell
    was researched.  It strikes as hard as a Major Shock, but the bolt arcs
    out in all directions and can hit many nearby targets.  Anyone or
 anything not in the caster's group will be affected by this attack.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
519  Telekinetic Disarm      Duration: Instantaneous                 TKDISARM

    This spell enables the caster to shape mana into a physical force. By
    merely concentrating on a victim, the air will harden around its weapon
    or shield and tear it from the victim's hands if it fails a spiritual
    warding.  If the caster has an empty hand, the force will conveniently
    place it there.  Otherwise, the item will be torn to the ground. This
    spell is ideal for peaceful wizards who still wish to defend themselves.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
520  Major Sleep             Duration: 10 seconds/level               MJSLEEP

    This spell works as Sleep I (501) except that it is effective on
    creatures of any level.  Furthermore, potency of this spell imposes
    an additional -25 to the target's attempts to ward against it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

525  Meteor Swarm            Duration: 1 to 3 minutes                 METEORS

    Perhaps one of the most destructive spells known to spell users is
    Meteor Swarm.  The caster throws his or her arms skyward while
    uttering the phrases of invocation.  While this seems innocent at
    first, within 20 seconds after this spell is cast, a devastating
    barrage of flaming meteors will begin to fall on the area
    inflicting terrible damage to anyone or anything unfortunate enough
    to be in the area.  The meteors will continue to fall in a wide
    radius around the area for several minutes after the initial
    strike.

    While this spell is much more effective outdoors, it may shake
    structures and injure those inside with falling debris.
