<center><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">It's funny how strongly events 
of the past affect attitudes of the present. I've often been asked why I have 
such a fear of magic and those who rely on it's power. To answer these questions 
I must return to the past, long before my birth.</p>

<p>Oh yes, first let me introduce myself. I am Talabrie D'Thrifty, half elven 
rogue and daughter or the dark elven swordswoman, Talabrina Darckedge, for who I 
was named and the human rogue Larenfro Thrifty. I was raised in a small village 
close to the town of Icemule Trace. It was a place of friendship and peace until 
they came.</p>

<p>They were a group of wizards and sorcerers who were unhappy about the 
treatment the warriors in the village received. The warriors, being the 
protectors of the village were given the better homes and the pick of the meat 
gained in their hunts. The magic users were overlooked in many instances and 
they weren't pleased with this fact. The battles that were fought were fierce 
and many lives were lost on both sides. My mother, knowing her skills with a 
weapon were not sufficient enough to protect herself, hid during a good portion 
of the fighting. My aunt Talondria was spared because she fought on the side of 
the casters. When the opportunity presented itself my mother fled in fear of 
those who wished to destroy her home. She would return a few days later to see 
the destruction caused by those who had used their power for personal gain. From 
this point on she swore never to trust any who would use magic for any purpose.</p>

<p>Mother made her way to a place called Wehnimer's Landing and began building a
new life for herself. Alone in the world and armed with only sword, shield and
her meager skills she did fairly well for herself. She learned the way of the
sword quickly and soon gained more confidence in her ability. Then one day she
met a handsome rogue while out on one of her many hunts and fell hopelessly in
love. There was only one problem. He was human. She made many friends during her
time in this town and her love for the rogue grew deeper with each passing day.
Then one day The man asked my mother for her hand. She was so shocked she could
hardly speak. There was one thing standing in their way. He must first get
approval from her cousin, Romero, since He was the last surviving male in her
family. My father tried to explain that it didn't matter what her family thought
of their union, only that they loved each other and wished to build a life
together. She refused to answer him until he honored her request and removed her
armor, put away her weapons and shield and knelt down in the very spot they had
chosen to hunt that day.</p>

<p>Father was beside himself with the fear of watching these creatures harm the
woman he loved and facing her cousin. After Mother was struck the first time he
agreed to honor her request and went in search of Romero. After a long
conversation and many heated words he agreed to the union and the two were wed
the following Thrakmas. Mother was surprised to betaken to such a lovely chapel.
Father hadn't told he of the gift he has planned for her that day.</p>

<p>Everything was going better than either had dreamed. Until one warm spring
day just a few months after their wedding. Mother went out in search of her
beloved husband to give him some wonderful news. They were expecting the first
of what she hoped would be many children. She stopped to rest at the Wayside Inn
when a close friend found her. They greeted each other with a warm hug when she
noticed the sad look on his face. She asked what was troubling him and he just
led her to a table and gently sat her down. This worried her more than she cared
to admit. He began telling her of a terrible battle that had been fought between
her husband and a swarm of leapers. She knew the news he brought her was grim
even before he finished the account. Her husband was a weak fighter. His skill
was with his lockpicks, not his sword.</p>

<p>Before he finished the tale she was in tears. Her friend comforted her as best
he could and stayed with her until she calmed down. She explained to him about
the child growing inside her and how she would leave the city and move someplace
quiet to raise the baby. He offered to accompany her but she refused the offer.
She preferred to be alone. She only asked that he look out for the child if he
was ever needed. He agreed. He would do as she asked because he loved her. This
would be a fact Mother never knew.</p>

<p>So Mother returned once again to her homeland. She had hoped things would be
different than when she left so many years ago. They were different but not for
the better. The warriors of the village were treated no better than slaves, to
do the heavy work and to lead the patrols that protected the village. Mother was
immediately accepted as one of those warriors. She was able to reclaim her
family's home though, A luxury not many had been given. The house had been too
small for their purposes and had belonged to my aunt after Mother had left.</p>

<p>Once I was born Mother had to keep me hidden due to the fact that my blood 
wasn't 'pure'. I was part human. This would not have been tolerated by those who 
overlooked the running of the village now. So all my time was spent indoors or 
hidden away someplace if anyone stopped by to give Mother work orders. I spent 
my whole young life locked away and mostly alone. Over the years Mother taught 
me what she could about how to use a weapon and how to survive in the world on 
my own. I was very worried about her when she began to get thinner that was 
normal and I began asking questions. That was when she told me of my father and 
what a great man he had been. She told me of what this village had been like in 
her youth and what had been done to make her leave. I had witness what the magic 
users had called punishment and was afraid. Men were hurt with no marks left on 
their bodies. They were tortured in ways I could only dream of. Luckily Mother 
was spared any of these terrors because she followed orders and because my aunt 
had served them so well. I was told stories of her as well and wondered what had 
become of her.</p>

<p>Over the years I had discovered my father's belongings and would spend time
trying to pick simple locks with his picks. Until the day Mother caught me
trying to pick the lock on one of the many chests she had in the house. I wanted
to know what was inside. This was the first and only time we ever fought. I had
a right to chose my future. Why Was I forbidden to learn my father's trade?
Finally she agreed with one condition. That I learn to protect myself as well as
pick a lock. This seemed very reasonable to me since I enjoyed the weapon
training almost as much as the boxes. So my days were spent learning to protect
myself as well as trying to get those darned chests open.</p>

<p>Then one day I succeeded gentling the largest of them open. I was so excited
that I was careless. I flung open the box to find a beautifully crafted sword
and shield inside. As my flingers wrapped around the hilt of the blade I
received the worst jolt of my young life. I was stunned for only a second but it
was enough. I looked at my hand and found I was badly burned where My skin had
come in contact with the weapon. I had to know what could cause so much pain.
then I knew. It was a magical blade. I quickly closed the chest never wanting to
open it again.</p>

<p>The next box I got opened held an even bigger surprise. There was a lockpick 
case nestled into the most wonderful set of ruby studded armor I had ever seem. 
Why did mother chose not to wear such a thing into the battles she fought for 
the village? I would have to ask her. This time instead of reaching for the armor 
though, I reached for the case resting atop it. As I was getting ready to remove 
it from it's place I was once again greeted with a terrible jolt. My fingers had 
brushed against the lovely armor it sat upon. More magic. Now I knew why Mother 
didn't wear it. Over the next few years I learned more about the magical 
properties of weapons and armor but it seemed Mother's health was failing. I 
would hear her cry in the night when she thought I was sleeping. She began 
speaking to someone as she sat in front of our small fire. Eventually she 
stopped the lessons she had thought were so important in the beginning. This 
went on for quite some time.</p>

<p>One morning I awoke to find Mother in her bed with the most beautiful 
expression on her face. She actually looked truly happy. I had never seen her 
look so good. There had always been shadows of sadness behind her eyes even when 
she was smiling. There were no shadows to be found. I investigated further and
discovered my mother, whom I loved with all my heart, had been my only companion
all these years, my dearest friend, was dead. What was I to do now? She had
cared for me and kept me hidden for so long. How would I survive without her?
Where would I go? then I remembered the stories and decided to seek out the
friends she had left behind. She was with my father once again and was happy for
the first time in many years. My life was just beginning.</p>

<p>I quickly packed up what I could, being careful with the enchanted items so I
wouldn't get burned again and set out for the town she had spoken so fondly of. I
looked back in tears because of what had to be left behind. Perhaps one day I
would be able to reclaim it all and the village as well. I had such big dreams
then.</p>

<p>It was a long, hard journey but I made it alive. I finally made it to the gates
of a very large, busy town. People were walking in and out the gates and never
even noticed me standing there taking in all the sights and sounds. I stopped
someone and asked where I was and he told me I had arrived at the Landings. I
thanked him as he went on his way looking back at me in confusion. All of a
sudden I felt a large hand rest upon my shoulder. I spun around, sword in hand
ready to take on any threat. He took a quick step back with his hands in plain
sight showing he had no weapon and blushed slightly. He explained that I kind of
reminded him of a friend he had lost long ago and began to walk away.</p>

<p>Fearful of being alone in such a big place I quickly asked who it was I 
reminded him of. I had to ask him to repeat the name because it sounded a lot 
like mine. The second time he said it I realized he was speaking of my mother 
Talabrina. I instantly told him who I was and how the woman he had mistaken me 
for was my mother. I asked him if he knew any of her friends and he told me he 
knew them all. He also told me how much he had loved my mother and had wished to 
go with her on her journey. She had denied his request and he was hurt by the 
refusal. But had since gone on with his life.</p>

<p>The next few days were a blur of faces and new friends. I met everyone who had
known my mother. After the third day it was all getting to be too much and
needed some time alone. I headed out to the cliffs close to town to do a little
hunting. That was when I met him. I was hacking away at a creature who decided I
looked like a tasty lunch when he approached. He asked me if I had any treasure
boxes that might need opening and as luck would have it I did.</p>

<p>I found out his name was Zackrim and we hunted the day away together. He was a
handsome elven rogue who had stolen my heart with the first words he spoke. If
Mother had felt like this when she met my father, no wonder she missed him for
all those years. I understood so much now.</p>

<p>The next few years couldn't have been better. I was now allowed to pick boxes, 
I had made a promise to my 'Uncle' to wait until I had trained a bit more before
trying it and for the most part I stuck to the agreement. I knew it was only a
matter of days before Zack would ask me to marry him. We were so good together.
Always by each other's side and I was a good partner for him because like my
father, he was a weak fighter. I was filled with fear each time I found out he
went hunting without me. I was so afraid of receiving the same news Mother had
received all those years ago. but there was really only one shadow darkening my
life.</p>

<p>My 'Uncle' who I loved like a father had met with my Aunt Talondria. The two 
fought constantly. It was obvious Talon hated the choice Mother had made and 
never had a good word to say about her sister. Then one day my Uncle had had
enough and attacked my aunt. Since she wasn't expecting it she was nearly killed
before she had a chance to answer with an attack of her own.</p>

<p>Soon after the confrontation I learned that the two were engaged. This was to 
be the beginning of the end of my happy life. Just a few weeks after they 
announced their engagement Word was sent that my uncle had been killed trying to 
aid someone else. But that was his way. He always put others before himself.</p>

<p>But I still had Zack to get me through these hard times and his strength was a
great help to me. Not long after I was sent word that I had lost my grandfather
as well. I was losing all those I loved one by one. I held on to Zack like a
lifeboat on a stormy sea. 'Please don't let me lose him too', I thought over and
over. This was the saddest point in my life and didn't know how much more I
could take.</p>

<p>then one day my greatest fears were realized. Just days before we were to
announce our engagement I awoke to find a message beside my pillow with a red
rose beside it. My dear sweet Zack had been called away and would possibly never
return. My beloved rogue was gone too. I had no one left. I was alone again with
no hope of ever finding real happiness. I spent days in my room just crying, not
eating and refusing to see anyone. I gave up all my lockpicks except those my
father had left to me. I even stopped hunting. My mother's sword was coated in a
layer of rust in no time. I had no hope of ever seeing daylight again. I spent
time alone waiting to die.</p>

<p>I spent the next four years alone, with no one to love and no one to love me. 
I spent the days walking in a fog searching for a man I was never able to find
hoping one day Zack would return to me in some form. Then I net Zenoir. He was a
young giantman who seemed more lost that I felt. I took him in and began caring
for him. He is a sweet enough boy anyway.</p>

<p>Not long after I got a message from my cousin Mav that said a friend of his 
was in need of a locksmith and I met Trenmarc. This was the beginning of a new 
life. I learned of a group of people who wanted to make a difference in the world
around them and I was very interested. In the mean time Zenoir just had to
introduce me to his father Dantilli and we hit it off right away.</p>

<p>My young son seemed to believe Dan and I should get married and started 
pushing us together. I'm still not sure if this was good or bad. My heart still 
belongs to another and I'm sure that will always be the case. I do regret that 
no matter who I become involved with in the future there will always be a shadow 
lurking in the background. One of a handsome elven rogue who stole the heart of 
a young girl so many years ago.</p>

<p>I have since been Pledged and initiated into the Clan Faleen and feel as 
though I belong to a family for the first time in my entire life. My aunt 
Talondria is still wandering around town someplace but she and I were and will 
never be close. Dantilli and I have become engaged but there is a fly in that 
ointment. I received a message not too many days ago that my beloved Zack is 
trying to make his way home to me. Perhaps this story will end happily after all.</p></font></center>
