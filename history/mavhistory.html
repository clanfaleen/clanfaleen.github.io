I was born in a very remote village far north of Icemule Trace. It was a very 
uneventful life I was brought up to be a warrior and a hunter. Well one day when 
I was out training with my elder brother with my little sister watching on as she 
normally did when my brother and I heard a very unusual noise and he went to 
investigate. I waited to for him to return I saw for the first time my first troll 
to my horror I saw my first mountain troll in my rage for its invasion of my home 
I went to attack it when I heard my little sister scream torn between duty and 
family I sheathed my sword and grabbed my sister and ran for the village when I 
got there I saw several of the townsmen had already fallen and I stopped to help 
drag a fellow clansman to safety setting my sister down and telling her to run for 
shelter that was the last time I saw my sister. after helping with the others I 
was told to run for the shelter and told that I must help protect the younger 
ones with much reservation and a growl of frustration I ran for the shelter as I
approached it I heard a growl of battle fury and turned in time to see the
most horrible creature I had ever seen later I learned it was a thunder trolls
launch a lightning bolt at me. At the last min my older brother jumped
in between me and it and I watched my brother die giving his life for me. I was
hit by something from behind me and don't remember much after that till I awoke
several hours later with my head aching and the taste of blood on my lips. I
tried to ask questions but as I looked around I realize I was the eldest member
of my clan left alive how could this be we were the strongest clan of northern
giantman and we fell to such a lowly creature as a troll. Well to make the
story go quicker I spent many days burying the remains of my clans man and
friends and family . I spent most of the 10 years after that raising the last
of my clans children and trying to figure out what to do when on a hunting
trip I came across another hunting party of Giantmen and proceeded to tell
them of what had happened and they told me that they would take us all in I
accepted for my clansman but I had to leave I had to seek revenge for my clan
the trolls have to pay. After a short time to make sure that my clans children
were safe I grabbed me some food and weapons and headed south to find where
the trolls were so I could slay them all. I shortly came upon a city called
Icemule trace where I learned the first things I would learn about fighting
monsters. After a short time I decided that I needed to head south I knew the
trip would be rough but I had to make it I had to find the trolls. My trip was
rough and very short before an ice troll took my head and used my body for
bobsled. The only two thoughts in my head while I was waiting to be rezzed was
one I am going to kill all trolls and that life had to look up from there.</font></p></center>
