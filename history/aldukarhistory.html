<center><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">I was born on the small
island of Marn. It really is small, not much more than a speck of dirt in the 
wide blue sea. The original natives, if there were any, had long since fled or 
been killed by human folk. At some juncture a monastery to Voln was established 
there...most likely to provide a far away sanctuary for those priestly types 
and their odd monkish ways. My extended family had landed on this isle about 
400 years ago and was 'tolerated' by the locals. They set up a small enclave, 
worked the land, raised children, crafted beautiful items, and summoned dark 
spirits and demons...you know, good dark elf stuff.</p>

<p>Actually, the patriarch, my father Thrakus san'Peldar, was a simple man.
He had no measurable mystic powers and only small knowledge of the blade. Our
family was exiled from our original community for, ummm, shall we say "taking
financial advantage of the slow witted". But, as I grew up on the isle, I
took to reading the fanciful tales of heroes and wizards in the meager Voln
libraries and decided that a warrior and swashbuckler was what I needed to
be. Of course the monks had no problems with this. They welcomed me
into Voln's embrace simply because the seas around us were high and
dangerous....many a ship crashed out in the reefs....and many a dead sailor
wandered our beaches.</p>

<p>So I hacked and killed and chopped and maimed and destroyed these vile and
powerful undead. I thought myself master of the lands, a hero
unparalleled in martial prowess.</p>

<p>But then the fire mages and magess came.</p>

<p>You see, not far away from my small isle, was another larger isle. Adorned
with a large and smokey volcano and populated mostly by dwarves. Well, as
I said, "mostly populated". Deep in the heart of the volcano lived
a rather large community of fire loving mages. With skin of burning sulphur and
hair of living fire, they worked their mysteries deep in the heart of Teras Isle.
And then, one day, a handful of them conjured up a chariot of ash and flew
across the waters to visit a certain Voln monastery.</p>

<p>And killed everyone.</p>

<p>My family, the monks, everyone. All dead. Charred husks and burning bones
were all that remained. Oh, and I do mean "everyone". I took my trusty
blade in my hand, armed with the conviction of Voln, and marched out to do
battle with these "paltry" mages.</p>

<p>And I was killed.</p>

<p>Arcane spells danced about me and dark magics blasted me. My life was
snuffed out by spells like a candle in a hurricane. My body was blown out
to sea and for many days I floated....my spirit clung to me only due to my many
favors of Voln and my conviction to eventually have revenge.</p>

<p>And then, I floated into the landing. A bloated corpse, partially decayed,
but not entirely. A cleric whose name is lost in time resurrected me and
thus I found myself in the Wehnimer's Landing, with no family, no friends, or
most importantly, no silvers or gear.</p>

<p>....well....I'll stop right here for the time being...</p></font></center>
