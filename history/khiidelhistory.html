<center><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">The Elvin empire flourished for thousands of years, keeping rule and 
tight reign on other races. Till the horde of Undead came, starting the long and enduring undead war.
Though the elves had won the war, with the help of other races, they had lost
their empire.  Their army had nearly been decimated and they lost most of
their rein on the lesser races.  There were Seven houses of rule: Faendryl,
the masters of spiritual and elemental magic and the major house of rule in
the circle; Vaalor, house that provided most the warriors and tactitioners;
Nalfein; who used their stealth and political intrigue to gain favor among
other houses; Ardenai, woodsman and hunters and very close to the sylvans that
stayed in their precious forests after the Urdaemon war; Ashrim, sea faring
elves and fisherman; Loenthra, adept in craft and poetry, their bards
legendary for their talent; Illistim; Scholars and historians.  It was because
of the Faendyl using ancient and dangerous magic that the elves won that
bloody war, but in the aftermath of it they lost most of their favor among the
other houses.  Inside the house of Faendryl there were many minor sects
dedicated to different magic, from summoner to healer, one very unique and
unknown sect were the Ta'Ailen, walkers of dreams, They learned to walk mens
dreams by use of the arts.  Their abilities helped the Faendryl greatly in the
game of houses, keeping them high in power.  Even the Nalfein's political
intrigue couldn't out do what Ta'Ailen seen in a rival houses dreams.  The
dreamers learned that the other six houses were going to betray the Faendryl
and exile them to the cursed land they had blistered with their art.  This
sect fled before the other houses attacked Faendryl and had them banished
vowing to unite the seven houses and restore the elven empire to rain in
Elanthia. Many generations they stayed in hiding, passing their vow from
father to son, along with their knowledge of dreamwalking and magic, that
someday they would reunite the seven houses.  Ta'Ailen were very adept in
spiritual magic, with that talent they improved themselves and sought out
others by means of  dreams.  Over time their numbers grew but also the
Ta'Ailen divided into two groups, one wanting too keep elven blood pure for
the reunion, restoring  of the old ways and the old rule where elves were the
rulers and lesser races their subjects, this sect called themselves the
jintar, pure ones.  The other however wished to bring new rule to the lands,
where all races would be considered equal among the great houses, adopting
houses of their own, they were called the Kan'tel, bringers of change.</p>

<p>In the Kan'tel, a young man rose to power, having adept hold on both
spiritual and elemental magic he was looked upon as a firm but just leader.
Markael Juntar Maerdrym was unrivalled in power among all the elves, his
sorcery was awed upon as being a Faendryl reborn, he learned to envoke upon
the elements from his wife, Eleida Jade Maerdrym, who came but a few years
earlier wishing to restore order among the lands. A few years after went mostly
uneventful, usually the Kan'tel wanting to move right then and restore order
and the Jintar arguing that they had not learn enough about the other houses
to risk showing themselves, even age old betrayal runs strong with elves.
Eleida was beginning to grow in favor and in size, she was carrying's
Markael's child in her belly.   The elders among Kan'tel foreseen that it was a
boy, one who would bring disaster to the Ta'Ailen, but also bring change and
redemption among the two sects within, Jintar and Kan'tel.  The Jintar loathed
change, believing in the old ways and set in tradition. One dreary night
Eleida and her loving husband were strolling along the ocean shore when
Markael felt an itch between his shoulder blades, as if someone was watching
him. Summoning up his power and clearing an image in his mind he uttered a
small chant, leaving the word of power still on his lips till he was sure it
was an attack.  Rushing towards his hut holding his wife near he darted his
eyes from shadow to lurking shadow whoever had tried to locate him or his wife
would surly be close by, their village wasn't that big.  Reaching the door to
their hut they were greeted by three members of the Jintar, lounging around
their common room as if they owned the place.  "What are you doing in here
Tor'bel, Lon'ah, Gerhan?!  Have you know honor?  Breaking into another mans
house like this! What is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"Quite simple really." the first to reply was Tor'bel, a lanky elven man with
short cut dark brown hair and chiseled features, the maidens of the village
might think him handsome if it wasn't for his dark temper and enjoyment of
torturing others, it was because of them two traits the Jintar found him a
worthy inquisitor.  "We cannot let your wife have that child.   You yourself
have heard the predictions, and we cannot allow anything to stop us in our
quest to restore the nation to its rightful rulers!"  The other two, Lan'ah's
Dark eyes peering about the room as if assassins would dive from the cupboards
at any moment, she was handsome but her features were too rough to be
considered beautiful, and Gerhan was one of the ugliest elfs ever created by
the gods, it was disputed that he was half elven because of his bulbous nose
and squared jaw, a lot stockier than most elfkin he stood a fool 3 hands above
most other in the village and was twice as wide at the shoulders as the local
blacksmith, who was Human!.  They just snarled softly and nodded in agreement
with Tor'bel.</p>

<p>"No harm will befall my wife while I live, I don't care what was foreseen.  If
you think you can barge in here and demand her not to have our son, you are
either mad, or stupid." spat Markael as he glowered at the three, none of them
could best him with a blade or with the arts, he was unparalleled in his
magical prowess, and only one other man could best him with a blade, who
happened to bet he blademaster of their sect. But together in such an enclosed
space as the tiny hut they might get the better of him. "I suggest ye go sleep
off whatever you drank before anything bad happens to any of us." He tried to
smile but it came out as a half snarl to them. How Dare they enter my house
and order this? Foreseeing or not I will not let any harm come to my love.</p>

<p>Tor'bel raised an eyebrow and stood up, Markael's hand extinctive went for
where his blade would be and cursed, it lay on a stand on the hearth ten paces
away, the three of them would drop him before he even made it half that
distance, Gerhan wasn't much for skill but the sheer bulk of him allowed him to
hammer down his opponents defenses in duels. Without that he was a useless
goon willing to crack heads for a silver piece.   Tor'bel's skills lie in the
art, not the blade.  He was just as much use with one as without. About the
best he could manage was not to lop his own foot off whenever the swordmasters
tried to teach him the ways of the blade. Despite Lon'ah being a woman, she
was almost as good as himself, almost.  With the other two to worry about she
could best him easily with a blade, even armed, which he wasn't at the moment.
The sigil of his invoked spell still burned in his memory, that made him give
a smug smile.  If they so much as breathed violence he could send them reeling
in pain. That smile made Gerhan raise his eyebrow as well, his hand moving to
his blade.  That was all the violence Markael needed, nearly shrieking the
word of power he shot out his hand, the air between him and the trio of
trespassers seemed to shift and dance as he reached out to their minds with a
whip of energy cracking it at the trio.  Lan'ah and Gerhan almost toppled over
one another, both weeping and whimpering in silent agony.  Tor'bel on the
other hand only winced as if he had been slapped. He was prepared for the
attack.  He immediately begin uttering his own dark spell.  Markael
instinctively built up his defenses against mind attacks, but Tor'bel did the
unexpected.  Shooting his hand forward a silver nimbus sprung forth, streaking
the length of the room towards what Markael knew he shoulda been protecting,
his wife and unborn son.  His heart fell to his feet as the nimbus struck
Eleida in the chest, propelling her back against a bookcase he kept behind the
front door.  She crumpled to the ground as if her body lost its bones.  Tears
filled Markael's eyes and he seen through the haze of heartfelt pain that
Tor'bel was smiling, not a wicked smile he usual had but a smile of smug
satisfaction, a smile that a bakor worn when another complimented his
products.  Markael didn't even know what happened next, one moment he was ready
to fall to his knees and weep for his wife and the next minute a strange sigil
roared like the sun in his mind.  So complex it made his mind hurt just to
concentrate on it, but he began gesturing and chanting and calling the sigil
from his mind into being using his own energy, arms outstretched he lashed out
with his quickly waning strength.  A gout of white hot flame shot out at
blinding speed streaking towards the three Jintar.  Tor'bel didn't even have
time to scream as the gout encompassed him, his body writhing in a gruesome
silhouette amidst the white hot flame. Gerhan and Lon'ah had been lucky in
comparison, but still screamed in pain as the flames touched them. Lon'ah
raised her arms to shield her eyes or it would have missed her completely,
instead her arms from the elbow down were burned into unrecognizable stumps
that she stared down at in shock.  Gerhan was laying on his back as the gout
went over him, not touching him exactly but the sheer heat of it had burns him
considerably along his face and his arms. He still lay there even after the
flames were gone...crying like a homesick child.  The stench of Tor'bels
smoldering corpse filled the room quickly but it was lost to Markael's
senses, all his attention was on the white clad heap that lay beside him..he
rushed to her falling beside her and pleading for her to still be
breathing..rolling her over to her back he seen her eyes were closed tight,
her breath nothing but small uneven rasps.  On her chest was a fist sized hole
burn through her blouse and into her flesh.  He quickly scooped her up and
rushed out of the hut, heading for the empath's hut.</p>

<p>Norvelle Sat at a large tanik desk, rifling through studies of common
illnesses and injuries, The husky human woman despised how many children come
to her hut seeking healing.  The red rot that all but destroyed the dwarves
back in the day, but some minute cases can still be found.  A few children
that have come to the small village show meek symptoms of the plague but on a
much smaller scale, She decided to name it the Red Flu,  Non lethel if cared
for quickly, but just as dangerous as its ancestor if let run rampant, and it
spread like the pox, especially among small children.  Just as she was about
to blow out the small ivory candle on her desk a thunderous pounded
reverberated from her door.  Half muttering about the time she scuddled over
to the door. Prying loose the hardened fel bolt and letting the door swing
open her round face drained of color.  Markael stood outside, clutching the
still form of  Eleida, his face a mask of shame and horror.  Brushing past
Norvelle with fluid grace and heading hastily towards a small cot on the west
wall of the hut, he deposits Eleida gently on it.   Backing away from his wife
he pleads in a voice too meek to be his own, "help her, Norvelle please help
her"</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can Markael, but let me some room, and go fetch Kail and
Elain for me, don't dawdle!" Norvelle commanded, and Markael vanished through
the door with more speed than she thought possible. She turned and examined
Eleida with her dull grey eyes.  Eleida never was very big, her belly almost
looked artificial on her, usually a tanned skin woman her face was now pale
and drawn, almost gaunt, Her heart a feint thump inside her chest, under a
hole the size of Norvelle's hammy fist and as deep as her pinky.  The burn all
but sealed the wound so there was no bleeding, but Eleida's breath was shallow
and her heart was slowing, she was dying.  Tears welled up in norvelle's eyes>
as her mind reeled with a answer, a way to help this poor woman, suddenly it
came to her.  Diving from the bed and running to a large taek strongbox
in front of her desk, she fumbled the key into the lock and opened it..throwing
herbs and clothes every which way, till she found what she sought, a small
stone figurine about the size of her hand, a plump little man holding a tree
in one hand and a the other on his chest in salute, this relic could focus
mana into healing energy for those who know how to use it, very useful to an
empath.  Seizing the figurine she ran back to Eleida.  Clutching the figurine
in her hand and placing the other over Eleida's burn, she channeled all her
mana into the figuring and felt her hand grow cool as ice above the wound.
Several minutes of this was all she could do before collapsing out of her seat
and onto the floor fatigued, Kail and Elain rushed to her side, she never even
seen them come in, they took over and let her rest though.</p>

<p>Markael paced outside the hut as the first rays of the sun put an end to the
tragic night, Many thoughts were clashing in his head.  Revenge, mourn, loss,
hope...but they all seemed distant, the only thing that kept him was that door,
that door was the answer, when it opened he will know to rejoice and seek
revenge, or to mourn and still seek revenge, it all depends on what news come
from that door.  He felt worry deep in him for the worst, but hope for the
best,  and shivered at the clash of feelings. Finally the door opened and out
stepped Kail, dark rings around her tilted eyes from the nights work, but she
wore a grim smile, "your wife lives Markael, but we know not how long, the
baby stirs within her, if it comes in her weakened state they could both
perish."  Markael didn't know weather to be sad or happy, Our child could mean
her death? the foretells could be true. "Can I see her?" he asked humbly. "Let
me see my wife!" it came out a bit harsher than he wanted it to, but Kail
nodded her head and moved from his path, and he entered the small hut.</p>

<p>The shades have been drawn to let the light in, but a darkness shadowed the
room due to the woolen tapestries over the windows.  Elieda lay on the cot,
resting, her color still to lighter than natural but better than it was the
eve before. Two more cots had been erected for the healers to sleep on, taking
turns with the figurine they worked all night on his wife to bring her outta
deaths embrace, the succeeded in a way. Markael moved over to the cot and knelt
beside it, brushing away her dark hair he gently kissed her forehead, and
muttered a vow of revenge upon the Jintar, the thought of them made him stand
rigidly, quivering with rage at what they had done to her. He stalked out the
door and passed the scared Kail, still shaken by the murderous look on his
face.</p>

<p>Tragedy struck late that afternoon, Elieda bore a young boy at the cost of
her life, meanwhile across the village Markael in his fit of rage decimated
the Jintar in his rage and was finally captured by members of his own sect,
Learning of Elieda's death and young Khiidel's birth shook him at his very
core, very few Jintar escaped his rage but they fled out of the village,  A
small council found him innocent of murder due to his rage for what happened
to his wife at the hands of the Jintar, and made him free to raise his son
alone..but he was never to try and lead them again.  Markael was forever
changed that day..The day his son killed his wife, the way he thought it.</p>

<p>Years passed like the turnings of a page and Khiidel grew into a stout young
lad with an adeptness for the elements, even more adept than his father but
unable to grasp spiritual magic.  Markael thought him all he knew about the
elements and give him all of the books he ever had on Elemental magic. Khiidel
studied with abandon, easily absorbing knowledge at a dangerous rate, he also
grew a lot of followers within the Ta'ailen.  His brash humor and quick wit
earned him a lot of gratitude among his elders..even being the son of a man who
destroyed half of them. When it come to dreams Khiidel was very unique, long
since they had learned that dreamwalking required firm grasp on the spiritual
circle, complete mastery of spirit essence, but Khiidel could move in and out
of dreams at will with no grasp at all on spiritual magic.  This frightened
the elders, dreamwalking and foretelling was their anchor of power, with a
elemantalist able to do it..alot of the masses followed instead of the
council.  Khiidel also had another unique gift, sometimes in his dreams he
would be pulled into the dreams of men long dead, relived deaths of powerful
people along the events of time, he could see into the past via these dreams
better than anyone else could, with that knowledge he formed a plan, to
reunite the seven pointed star, and bring order to elanthia under new rule..</p>

<p>Khiidel woke up one sunny morning to a tap on his door, shambling outta bed
and into his leather trousers he strode across the tiny hut to the front door,
fumbling the latch and opening the door he was greeted by a stunning woman of
alian features, Darker than most elves in the village with paler hair and
eyes, but even with the difference he couldn't slow his heart, short for an elf
standing only up to his chest, she give a formal curtsey and introduced
herself. "Greetings grand Khiidel, I am J'ehla Faendryl, descendant of the
mighty house Faendryl, and I hear you wish to reunite us as one to bring
elanthia out of its depression, is this true?"</p>

<p>Khiidel meant to say, "yes, all are welcome here and I wish to bring all races
into order and out of chaos"  but it came out as something more like babbling,
 J'ehla giggled musically and a crimson hue appeared on her cheeks. Khiidel
attempted to smile but it only come out as a nervous grimace, all his effort
kept his legs from shaking uncontrollably.</p>

<p>A few years passed and Khiidel and J'ehla grew to love one another, her
knowledge of the Faendryl helped further his plan faster than he had ever
imagined.  Not quite 20 he had grown to be the most powerful man in the
Ta'ailen village.  But with his growth a hate grew inside his father,
remembering his birth at the cost of his beloved's life.  Markael stayed away
from Khiidel and never told him why.   Each time Khiidel approached Markael
now the stubborn man would whisk away through a gate before Khi could get as
much as a hello off.</p>

<p>One midwinter afternoon in his study with J'ehla, now his wife, Khiidel
formed a plan to bring the races back to rule and divide the lands among them. 
With a Elanthian senate including members from every ruling house or clan
among these races to lead them.  He thought his plan perfect, and sprinted to
the council to tell them.  Rushing into the building that housed the council
of elders for the Ta'ailen, Khiidel was greeted by a horrific sight, among the
long fel counter lay the bodies of every elder, most burned beyond
recognition, some with their throats cut and their eyes still wet from crying
before the knife severed their life.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room stood Markael and 4 others, discussing
something..Khiidel eavesdropped long enough to catch the last.  "...we strike
at dawn, Lord Markael.  These bringers of change" the stout darkelf, or what
j'ehla labeled them as, spat out that phrase as if it was poison on his lips
"..will be no more.  I will personally see their leader's head is brought to
you, an all out attack by us he will least expect, knowing most of us are
still underground"  Khiidel's blood boiled in his veins, his own father,
plotting against him and trying to undue all that he stood for and what
markael once stood for once..summoning a sigil of power into mind he stepped
completely out of the shadows of the entry way to face his would-be attackers.</p>

<p>"Father, what have you done..can you see all the blood on your hands from
this, slaughter?"  Khiidel kept his voice calm and soothing, attempting to not
provoke a fight, being seriously outnumbered, his temper had put him into a
cooking pot, the 4 darkelves slowly circled him, hands resting lazily on sword
hilts.</p>

<p>"No son, I betrayed no one here...you betrayed us all, its not natural yer
ascension to power, surely the dark ones themself have sent you to corrupt the
Ta'Ailen's noble cause, restoring order to the lands and power to the elven
nation." markael too had his hand resting on his sword hilt, on a one on one
fight Khiidel might be able to best his father, he was quicker by far and had
learned how to alter time in a minor way..making him seem a blur next to the
others, the thought of a duel with his father made his hand instinctively
tighten on his own sword hilt, never knowing his hand moved to the hilt in the
first place. Markael's eyes narrowed at that action and within a breath his
sword was drawn, as were the others, darkened blades glistening in the dim
light.</p>

<p>Khiidel knew he couldn't avoid a fight, he quickly released the sigil from his
mind and called up a protection spell, gesturing with ease he formed a shroud
of protection around himself just in time for it to be battered by fire from
Markael's outstretched hand, one of the dark elves, taller and more lithe than
the others, was also enchanting a spell.  the other three warriors advanced
slowly, testing his vision for blind spot and moving to where they could at
all angles. But Khiidel was quicker still than the darkelven mage. Calling
forth the sigil with a quickly muttered phrase and releasing it, time seemed
to slow down, and then the warriors advanced, unnaturally slow. From what
J'ehla had told him Darkelves were more adept now with the arts and a lot
quicker too over time in the underdark had changed more than their
complexion. Khiidel easily killed the first with a strike to the throat while
he had his sword back to swing for khiidel's head.  Bringing the blade back
and turning in one fluid motion he hamstrung the second and was back to guard
from the third before even a cry was let out. the third's blade rang off
khiidel when it struck, in the altered time you could see tiny sparks dance
between the blades slowly before his blade repelled his attackers.</p>

<p>The darkelf mage finished his spell and his body began to melt into the
background ..almost as if he was fading away. Invisibility! Khiidel thought to
himself as he pierced the third warriors heart with a quick lunge, then time
sped up considerably. next thing he knew markael had hit his shield hard with
another ball of fire, Khiidel could feel the intense heat the fire came so
close to him..the dark elf was still no where to be found.  Suddenly without
warning the darkelf materialized right in front of him..angry blade slithering
in his hand as if it was a part of him.  Khiidel ducked just in time, the
blade passed inches above his head.  Khiidel drove his sword up underneath
the mages ribcage, piercing his heart.  With a few gurgled breaths the mage
slid off his blade. leaving him to face his father, alone.</p>

<p>"your dogs have failed father.  soon the whole village will be prepared for
your evil raid, and you will be gutted and piked over an ant hill for your
treason!"  then all the air exploded out of his longs making Khiidel cry out
in pain and toppling forward, it felt like someone had punched him hard in the
back but he felt the pain of the blade being removed from his back.. Barely
keeping his feet under him he turned around. standing just inside the doorway,
bloody dagger in hand, was J'ehla, "W'why?  I loved you." Khiidel said softly
underneath his pain, not from the dagger wound just inches from severing his
spine, but from the shattered dream of love he cherished for so long.
"Ta'Ailen dies with you, Lightbringer.." J'ehla used to always call him
Lightbringer, the darkelven lingo had changed over the generations a little
bit, that's what Kan'tel meant where she was from, "..I have fulfilled my task here.  Markael?"</p>

<p>Markael strode up to khiidel, barely hanging onto his consciousness, Insanity
shone in his eyes with a warm crimson hue of murderous intent, and he smiled,
a smile giving no joy, only pain to Khiidel. "20 years ago you took my life,
my wife, my way of living, everything ..I planned on being your father and
living to old age with your mother, but you stripped that away from me..and
the council made me into a nanny goat for you, my only purpose was to raise
you, but you are unnatural, ye grew to fast, to fast. yes, you cannot be my
son..a demon are you, not my son, my son would stand beside me right now, not
stand in front of me..blocking me from a better goal.  You corrupted the entire
village with your evil, all the problems started with your birth, and they
will end with your death, oh no. I'm not going to kill you here, that would be
to quick for a demon like you, you are going to die far from your home, alone,
just like I will die because of you.  Share my curse, Khiidel Maerdrym, and
remember it."  with that Markael brought down his sword hilt, crashing it into
khiidel's head with a sickening Thump.</p>

<p>Khiidel awoke in a small cot inside a small stoneworked room, his injuries
bandaged, and remembering nothing, except his name and the lingering fear of
the past and trust.  Jack, the weaponsmith in Wehnimers landing, and his wife
Nursed khiidel back to health when the found him bloody on the forest path
through the upper trollfang.  The only remnants of his past were a tattered
and burned silk robe and a small signet ring.  After he gained enough strength
he set about to repay his debt to Jack and his wife, doing all he could to
help the blacksmith out, running messages and later producing iron. After
repaying his debt he sought out any knowledge he could find, hoping to
rekindle his memory as to face the fear that dwells in his heart.  He searches
still for answers to the past, and will speak to anyone who knows something he
doesn't, in a hope to someday learn who betrayed him so much as to leave a scar
stamped deeply in his heart.</p></font></center>
