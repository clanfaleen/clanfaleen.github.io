<center><font size="4" face="Tempus Sans ITC">Beginnings I grew up on Wisraith 
Lane just near House of the Rising Phoenix. We children in
the neighborhood played hide-and-seek in summer twilight or ran after the mutt,
who barked noisily and chased sticks, which he never brought back. It was then I
heard my father say so often, "Alive is good!" Being what I am, I more often
heard "Ktaaki, get offa me, ye great clumsy cow!" I towered over my
playmates almost from the time I could walk and if I was not tripping myself, I
was knocking some one or other of them off their feet. Many a playmate went home
to have bruises attended while I went home to have hurt feelings soothed. In
time I moved on from hide-and-seek and began to take my place in the life of the
Landing. There was no question about my life’s work; I’d been destined for
Lorminstra’s service even before I was born. Far from feeling fettered by this
understanding, I felt the comfort of knowing I would always have a place and a
purpose, no matter how clumsy I was. My training is for the service of
resurrection and the release of undead souls. A brief sojourn among those of the
bathhouse frightened me so much for my soul that I resigned within just a few
days. A kindly gentleman pointed out an old warrior to me and told me to listen
to his story. No, I don’t remember his name. He wore gloves with the fingers
cut out though. I always thought that was odd. Living With My Grandmother for
good or ill, one of the forces in my earlier life was my grandmother, Amaryllis
called the Firehand, a wizard as you might expect. For 20 years she romped
through the Landing, flirting and slaying with the single-mindedness of those
who literally have all the time in the world to learn a thing or pursue a hobby
to it’s last least detail. She was passionate; she loved without boundaries
for as long as such a thing could last; the last warrior that she fell for so
precipitately broke her heart and she never went out very much after that. I
only knew her after she had closed herself up in her room at the Silvergate Inn
and took to her magical studies with the same intensity she had poured into
everything else. On one of her rare forays outside the Silvergate, she took me
to Kai’s Shrine, west aways of the Kobold Forest. Up the hill we trudged,
through a grove of trees, to be met by the splendor of the Shrine itself and the
eight stones that guard and embellish it. She suggested with some force that I
study the stones and take their messages to heart; she then left me and went
into the Shrine to--I was never sure what her purpose was there. Perhaps she
prayed, perhaps she cursed, and perhaps she merely went because the statue
within reminded her so strongly of her last best lover. That is the reason I
always thought was the true one. I took her advice, an easy thing to do once I
had read the first talisman. It so struck me and its words were so poetically
woven that my eyes spilled over and it was some little time before I could go on
to the rest of them. They are written in my heart now, and I knew my own love
when I saw him because I knew they were written in his heart too. The most
important person in my life now is the splendid warrior and Tribune of Clan
Faleen, Mav Granitehand. The most important day of my life will be our joining,
and I rejoice every day that he loves me, as I love him.</p>
