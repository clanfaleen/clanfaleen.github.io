This room appears to be well kept and furnished. A giant brick fire place sits 
burning at the far end of the room and many paintings of adventurers and battle 
scences line the walls. Dimly lit, you peer around the room and a certain scence 
catches your eye. It is of a giant blue dragon destroying a village with many 
warriors, spell casters and others to help aid and revive. You slightly smell 
burning incense and look for it's source. Perched atop a chair sits a raven, and 
it's master comfortably seated below. This must be her.</p>

<p>"Greetings," she says and bids you to sit down. "I am Cerridween Sprinks, 
Magistrate of Clan faleen an' Empath by profession and half-elf in appearance. 
Please sit down and make yourself comfortable. I hear you wish to inquire about my 
past? Surely if you are willing to stay awhile I can tell you what you need to 
know." She smiles at you as you find a comfortable place on the rug before the 
chair.</p>

<p>"I can not tell you everything of my past, but you will know enough. My family 
is large and they are wonderful people but life didn't just start with those I am 
with now. I grew up in a small village, a very peaceful place near a lake. We were 
all farmers, not much for weapons or magicks, though a few did practice it was 
mostly simple healing spells or jokeful enchantments. We never knew what was 
coming for us." Cerridween raises her hand to brush it against her raven and 
smiles up at it a moment seemingly lost in thought then returns her focus to you.</p>

<p>"I was still young but maturing quickly, nearly reaching my 15th year. My 
parents dissapeared when I was just a baby so I had spent my whole life housed 
with the old shaman. The old elven woman believed in the healing powers of the 
raven. She was our village healer and worked her magicks to keep us all healthy. I 
was to learn her ways and keep us safe from disease and sickness. Everyone was as 
it should be until the day some warriors befell our village. They called 
themselves "Seekers," and talked of clans and battles. I was a curious young 
half-elf so of course I inquired further who they were." The raven quietly caws 
and you look up at it. It's eyes peirce deep in your soul as you stare at each 
other a full minute. The moment it looks away you rubs your eyes and shake your 
head, trying to clear yourself of that deep gaze. Cerridween chuckles and 
continues.</p>

<p>"There were about 5 seekers in all and I wish I could recall their names for 
you, but it's been so long. They stayed at our place, we were used to taking in 
guests, usually sick ones. The warriors were hungry and tired from their journey. 
They told us they were the Benefactor's order, To protect against the blue one 
was their mission, but the dragon's army had over powered them. 50 were chosen 
as "Seekers" and sent out. I don't recall the whole story but that's the gist of 
it. These 5 were of the 50 total sent to survive and seek out other clansmen. I 
was intriuged by this story and wished I could help." She pauses a moment 
appearing to be thinking, "I surely was up for adventure back then and I guess 
the old woman sensed this. I and another were studying the arts of healing and 
only now could I see the reason for that. Perhaps... one of us wouldn't stay in 
the village forever. I was that one."</p>

<p>"The seekers were only here to spend the night so I knew I had to be fast. I 
packed up my things. The old woman snuck into my room and tapped me on the 
shoulder, I shrieked so loud I could barely control myself. She really did scare 
me! At this point I wasn't sure if she would let me go, but when she handed me a 
sack of food and other supplies I knew she had her heart set on doing the best 
for me. She whispered to me, "Join them, I've already arranged for you and two 
other young ones to go, they're both male so you'll be a bit alone. I told them 
of your healing abilities and they welcomed the idea of you coming. Please hurry, 
they're leaving soon." You pause to take in the latest developments to 
Cerridween's story, then lean forward gesturing to for her to continue. She can 
only smile as she once again picks up her story.</p>
