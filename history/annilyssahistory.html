<center><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">What seems like ages ago, I 
made up my mind that I did not want to be a farmer. Seeing the workers come in 
after dark with blisters on their hands, and falling to sleep while trying to 
eat the same dinner they had day in and day out. This was not my idea of a 
joyful life. So, one day while listening to a traveling salesman say that he 
was heading to parts unknown with the bushels of turnips that he had just 
bought, I climbed under the tarp and hid myself amongst the bushels there. As 
he pulled away, I wish I could express the joy I had in my heart to be leaving 
behind the lands where my parents were murdered while I was still so young that 
I don’t remember anything of them. Orphaned and traveling alone, unknown to 
even the driver of the wagon, was a true turning point in my life.</p>

<p>Hidden between the bushels upon bushels of turnips, I dreamt of a better
life for myself. I vaguely remember the sway of the wagon lulling me off to
sleep. When I awoke, my toes and fingers were so numb, and I was so stiff
that I was not sure that I would ever be capable of moving ever again. I could
see my breath hanging like a mist in front of my face. Peering out from under
the tarp covering me and the turnips, I saw nothing but white and the tracks
stretching to the horizon behind us. What seemed like hours passed while I
huddled between the ice cold turnips looking for warmth, praying to the God’s
above just to be warm once more. Hours passed while I drifted between sleep
and awareness. Then, I began to hear voices around the wagon as we slowed. The
voices got louder and louder, as the wagon slowed to a crawl. Languages that I
had never heard. It was very frightening. So not to be seen as a stowaway, I
crept out from under the tarp and jumped from the wagon onto the icy streets.
I had arrived. Hungry, cold, and scared, but I was not on the farm anymore
God’s be praised. I was full of joy until I looked around. Not everyone here
had pointy ears. Some stood well over 6 feet tall. I was so curious that I
wanted to touch the clothing and armor that these strangers wore. I had never
seen anything like it. Smiling faces, others fighting in the streets. People
waving their hands in the air while they mumbled words I did not understand,
and to see the air they touched glow with a strange light. It was a strange
and curious land that I wanted to get to know better. For awhile I even forgot
my hunger and my numb fingers. While walking around town I saw another pointy
eared fellow. He was dressed in a long black cloak fashioned with a hood and
pants that I now know were breeches. And when he spoke to me, I understood
every word. He told me that his name was Vulkun and asked me if I were cold. I
replied that I was so cold I could not even feel my feet. He offered me his
cloak to wear and led me to a small inn where I could get warm.</p>

<p>God it felt so good to be in a safe place and warm again that while we were
sitting there my whole story came out. Leaving home, and my travels to this
town. He told me that he had traveled the same way once upon a time ago and
asked me if I wished to learn his trade. He called himself a rogue and
explained to me the beginnings of being a locksmith. I was more then
interested! I was fascinated! Vulkun took me under his wing and showed me how
to get around the township of Icemule Trace, how to pick boxes open for
people, and how to hunt. I began making my own money and found that I have a
passion for items fitted with diamonds. A gem that I had never seen before. I
began outfitting myself and after my fourth year of training with him, Vulkun
and I became engaged. Shortly after our engagement, We decided together that
we wanted to move to a bigger city that was not too far away from Icemule. The
name of the town was Wehnimer’s Landing. He asked a few friends of his to
place some spells on me so that I did not die on the journey, we collected all
of our belongings, and off we went. Our long walk to Wehnimer’s Landing was
uneventful, other than watching Vulkun slip on the ice every so often.</p>

<p>I continued to learn from Vulkun, I made friends, and started to love my 
life, but I missed having a family of my own. While listening to the thoughts in
my ear one evening, I heard a Lady speaking of her clan’s adption agency. And
having trained only 5 times, I did not feel that I was too old for a mother or
father to learn to love before I grew up.  I thought back to her and told her
that I was more than interested.  She found a match for me in a short amount
of time and set up a meeting for me to meet my prospective parent.  Later that
night, I met my father Lord Sirke.  We hit it off from the moment that we met. 
After speaking with him and learning that he too was a rogue, he asked if I
wished to become a member of his family.  I told him that I was engaged to be
married and that I wished for him to meet my fiancée before I could say yes or
no. Before I could say anything else, someone walked into the house we were in
casting a spell. I died immediately. Vulkun, feeling my death in his soul,
came running to my aid ready to defend my honor. Just to find everyone in the
house apologizing and doing their very best to resurrect me. This was not the
way I had in mind for him to meet my dad, but, things worked out well and
regardless of the circumstances, Vulkun and Sirke hit it off.</p>

<p>Our family grew. And it grew. And it grew. And after a few years, Vulkun and
I began our own family. We adopted our daughters Cenen, Baeril, Wholie,
Sallean, and our sons Relint, Sepher, and Groken. And now we have
grandchildren... Boy does time fly. At one time I had joined a clan in Elanthia
called Clan Snar. I heard of the homeland histories and became very active in
that clan. One day I met a stranger named Trenmarc. He was a seeker from our
homelands with a vision of rebuilding the rest of our homeland Clan’s here in
our lands. I believed in this vision. I felt it in my heart as he did , and I
began assisting him in his plight. I resigned from Clan Snar to assist in the
building of Clan Faleen because my heart told me that I was doing the right
thing. Now Clan Faleen is growing. I have high hopes that we will be able to
continue to grow not only as a family, but as a clan that assists the people
of Elanthia. Especially the new ones that just climbed out from under that
tarp that I hid under so many years ago.</p></font></center>
