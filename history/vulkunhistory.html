<center><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">As told by my parents it 
started on a winter night , they lived in a small hut within a Village of fisher 
folk along a frozen river just a days walk from Icemule Trace. A young woman 
knocked on the door of their hut and she carried an infant with her. When they 
saw her they knew she had not come from any place that they'd ever visited, the 
material and patterns of her clothing were strange.</p>

<p>She nearly begged them to care for her child, her husband was no where to be 
seen and when asked she replied that he had remained at their home to defend it 
with others against an evil so great she would not speak of it except to say 
that they must never allow her child to seek it out. The woman was of elven 
heritage and they assumed the child to be elven as well, it wouldn't be until 
years later they would find him to be actually half elf and half human. The 
woman disappeared and was never seen or heard from again.</p>

<p>Years passed and I began to notice things that were different between me
and my foster parents, first they were much larger then I, they explained
that they were known as Giant Folk, their ancestry was a mystery even to
them, all they knew was that the Village belong to the Clan of the Icebear. 
No records were ever written and only passed from Chief elder to Son or heir 
apparent.</p>

<p>Something was always missing though, I had dreams of a far away place,
faces that were hidden in a mist and a great evil that always awoke me in a
cold sweat. I got restless and started traveling to Icemule Trace and met
many different people there and was befriended by many. A ranger by the
name of Freebirrd found me playing around with a lockpick I had found on the
ground, it was a strange little devise that I found very interesting. He
took me to see a Master Locksmith and I began my training as a Locksmith,
less and less did I return to the Village and as a final gift my Father took
me aside and showed me the art of fighting, hand to hand, the blade and
even introduced me to a Master hunter that used stealth and ambushing
techniques.</p>

<p>I spent ten years learning and honing my skills, one day I found another
young half-elf maiden by the name of Annilyssa, she reminded me of me when
I first entered the city so I began showing her what I knew and introduced
her to the Masters who began training her. For many years we hunted,
picked boxes and tended to each other and my heart swelled every time I saw
her. I asked her to be my wife and she honored me by saying yes. Even with
the happiness that I knew, the dreams persisted except strange names began
to follow into the dreams one was Vulatarr, his image was of a human
dressed in plate armor and a sword almost as tall as he was and he wielded
it with the skill of a Master. Confused I asked my parents through a
courier about the name, they said the woman had named me after my Fathers
brother but she never said my Fathers name so Vulatarr was still a mystery.
We moved South to Wehnimers Landing and I could tell Annilyssa was missing
something in her life as well, one night as we sat at Thraks Inn tending
each other after a long hunt, we heard the thought of Lady Greeka inquiring
of youngsters wanting foster parents. I encouraged her to speak with Lady
Greeka and soon she was to meet with a possible Father, his name is Lord
Sirke. I saw her happiness in being with him as his daughter and my heart
swelled for her even more, still the dreams continued only now a female elf
was present with the human warrior and he called her Gwenalay. For many
years we lived in the Landing and we began to increase our own family by my
25th year we had 7 children and four grandchildren.</p>

<p>Lady Greeka also spoke of a Clan she belonged to, Clan Snar. When I spoke
with their leader who was Lord Sirke's brother, their story of their past
intrigued me enough to join them. They spoke of a place far away to the
North, beyond any known Maps and of a Great Blue Dragon also known as The
Blue One who was evil beyond all evil ever known, the names seemed familiar
and the evil spoken of as well seemed familiar. They spoke of other Clans
within their lands and the Clan named for the Puma seemed right to me or for
me. After a couple years I became disenchanted with Clan Snar when a seeker
from their home lands came from the wilderness, his Name is Trenmarc of the
Clan Faleen when he spoke of bring his own Clan forth in Elanthia I joined
him in his cause and became a Tribune. Still the dreams persisted and grew
in intensity.</p>

<p>One night I went to Eonakes temple and prayed for guidance and wisdom and
an answer to my dreams. To be honest I never expected an answer and
definitely not one like this, suddenly he appeared before me in my
confusion I leaped back into the bush, my combat instincts kicking in like
second thought.</p>

<p>"If you want answers then you must face me and you must be willing to loose
everything. Are you willing or shall I leave you to your questions?" he
said, his voice seemed to thrum inside of me and it seemed like he yelled
but I knew he was barely whispering. Making up my mind I stepped out of the
bushes, I knelt before him.</p>

<p>"I have to know what they mean or go mad." I replied.</p>

<p>"To find those answers means you will have to undertake a great quest,
greater then any you may have taken before. For this quest you will need a
different set of skills and a body that will make the journey possible. Are
you ready?" he replied, when I nodded. He waved his hand towards me and I
felt a fire burn in me and screamed, I heard popping and cracking sounds
and realized they came from inside of my body, I screamed again. I must've
passed out at that point because when I awoke I found my clothes were too
tight. At a small creek I saw my reflection, I had been transformed into
one of the giant folk.</p>

<p>My Family didn't understand, but after my story to them they accepted my
new look and condition. Another year passed with me learning new things not
only from a Master Warrior but from Trenmarc as well and gaining a new
Mother who adopted me during this time her name is Lady Claudeia. Trenmarc
spoke of never returning to his home lands because the Blue One had more
then likely defeated all opposition, but my heart was set, when the gods
told me the time was right I would begin my journey. One night as I slept I
dreamed of the strange places once again only this time Eonake was present,
"I make no promises that you will find what you seek, I gave you your body
to aid you. The lands that you have heard of from Trenmarc or Lajala may or
may not be the lands of your history that you will have to find out for
yourself. In the morning travel Northwards beyond all you've ever known or
heard about, once you are a day past the known lands you will know your way
and direction. My word of advise is this, settle your affairs now." he
said and I awoke.</p>

<p>With a final farewell I resigned my position from Clan Faleen, told my
family good bye and bid farewell to all I had ever known in search for a
past that may or may not exist, but then don't we all need to know for sure
where we all come from and why we are here?</p>

&lt;with a smile and a wave you see Vulkun walk out the gates of Wehnimers
Landing></p>

<p>:::A Courier arrives and leaves a rolled up scroll to be seen by Faleen
members:::</p>

<p>Last night I had a dream, my friends and family were gathered together to
speak about me, it turned into a nightmare when I realized it was actually
a memorial as they spoke of me in past tense. I woke up in a cold sweat and
knew I had better make sure everyone knows somehow that I am still kickin...
or in some cases runnin &lt;cough>. Hey maybe some of you can handle them
Glaciea, not I, they sneeze and I'm history and a smear on the walls.</p>

<p>It's been a while sense I left and have traveled up North of Pine Far, it
took a bit of hiding and sneaking to get past some of the creatures, but I
made it. Halfway through the day I found a young child threatened by a
couple black bears and proceeded to rescue the child, his Father wasn't too
thrilled, turned out the child was in training and I had messed up a full
days training, so sue me &lt;shrug> He did appreciate the gesture though and
together we walked to his small village and they provided a small hut for me
to lay my head.</p>

<p>The village moves with the seasons so they never got around to naming it,
I asked them about possibly seeing an elven woman years ago either carrying
a child heading south or alone heading North. They said they had seen a
young elf years ago heading North, she stayed alone and spoke to no one
during her time with them. They were traveling North at the time and for a
week she traveled with them, when they branched westward, she broke off on
her own continuing North east. It was an area that their own fathers and
grandfathers had warned them against ever going into those territories as
they were said to be cursed.</p>

<p>They are traveling North in the same direction they have always traveled
and have told me when they reach the place the elf had gone, they would
tell me so I may take her course as well. From the conversations we are
still two days away from the branch they spoke of. I will do my best to
continue sending reports of my journey, be safe everyone and I pray to the
gods for all of your safety.</p>

<p>To my Family and especially Anni...never loose heart.</p></font></center>
