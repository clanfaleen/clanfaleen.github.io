Of Friend and Fowl</p>

<p>I don’t know exactly of me origins. Still tryin ta sort all of that out. But 
me earliest memories are of Ice Mule. At least I knows I was born in those parts. 
Who my parents were exactly may never be known.</p>

<p>Me first mother as it were, was the penguin empress, whose name unfortunately 
be untranslatable into this common script. Seems I was never taughts enuf letters 
to write penguin. Raised on an early diet of pre-chewed, partially digested, fish 
and cold water greens, I seem able to stomach a wide variety of food stuffs. 
Maybe that explains me current cravin fer pickled orc toes. Anyways, the penguins 
did a good job if I says so meself. They kept me greased up as some sorta 
protection from the cold and learnt me many thinks about snow, ice and water. 
Penguins got an extraordinary vocabulary, though rather limited in subject 
matter. Ta think, what we’s call slush, alone has thirty or so descriptive 
variations in the penguin tongue. It has to do with the temperature of the water, 
the size of the ice crystals, and the amount of free water in the mixture. But 
don’t takes me own words fer it, go ask em yerselves. Though they do tends ta be 
rather shy and don’t speak much ta strangers.</p>

<p>I mades meself useful as I could. Not bein a great swimmer I couldn’t really 
dive fer fish the ways they did. But I did become rather adept with a driftwood 
stick at chasin away critters wantin to eat the penquin eggs. An later at scarin 
grizzle bars. Guess the bars couldn’t tell I was a human what wit bein covered 
wit grease from the blubber of beached whales and smellin of penquins ta boot. A 
bar’d comes stumblin into the nesting area or tryin ta attack me flock mates an 
suddenly I’d jump up screamin, squalkin and chatterin wavin me stick. That bar’d 
take one look, sniff and run off.</p>

<p>All was well an good till me teenage years. Then some hairy footed folk found 
me and decided they should take me in. Talk about shock. From fish and seaweeds 
ta tarts! I’d never tasted such things. Still gots a hankerin fer em as anyone 
whose tried ta drag me dead carcass will tell ya.</p>

<p>Still bein bigger than most of those about me, I agin became protector. Cept 
this time I gots an old broadsword an a reinforced shield. Seems the hairy footed 
folk were havin a particularly hard time wit rats tryin ta get thar tarts. So 
they sent me on a mission to rid the sewers of these vermin and ta learn me 
skills as a warrior.</p>

<p>The rest, well, seems I found me callin. Graduated from rats to bigger and 
nastier beasts, and continue to do so. Fer some reason these lands seems ta have 
a never endin supply of bad critters. Wantin a change from the cold I’d known all 
me life, I moved ta the Landin after me fifth visit to me warrior trainer. I 
ain’t never regretted it, though I sometimes go back an slide down the ice wit 
me penquin kin-folk up in Ice Mule and of course, stock up on tarts fer all 
occassions.</p>

<p>Invited ta join the Warrior Guild after me fifteenth train, I suddenly found 
others that filled some sorta family needs. I’ve worked hard at me Guild skills 
and was rewarded wit promotion to Warrior Guild Master. A master of warrior 
tricks I ken make sheaths, scabbards and slings and enjoy giftin them to the 
many friends I’ve made, though some have sadly left these lands fer good now.</p>

<p>At the invite of a good friend, I joined Voln as a new lordling and have 
since obtained the rank of Voln Master. The skills I learnt thar have saved me 
life more times then I ken count, and the lives of friends and others with whom 
me path has crossed on huntin expeditions. Havin been huntin in Varunar Castle 
fer almost twenty trainins now, I’ve lost count of the number of folk that I’ve 
rescued from decay by draggin, preservin and foggin ta safety. It was a glorious 
day when I could fog from the Caravansary ta Voln instead of ‘avin ta drag all 
the way to town fer help. In fact, that’s whar I met Tribune Exorr, who invited 
me ta join Clan Faleen. Though me schedule makes it nigh impossible to be present 
in the lands in the evenings or weekends, I hopefully have all of ya listed in 
me memory and rest assured, if yer ever in need, I will help as I ken. Mayhap
I finally found that family I been missin all me life. Although recently a 
youngin emerged from the woodwork claimin ta be a half-cousin of mine. Not so 
sure about him yet though, seems ta fancy himself a bit too much fer me tastes 
an has aspirations of bein a great sorceror.</p>

</p>Oh, some may call me short witted, foolhardy and mayhap insane in me huntin 
style, but rest assured, nothin be further from the truth. Well...at least I 
thinks so. Afterall, what could me more glorious than ta die facing five worms 
or a swarm of shadow mares an steeds while commin to the aid of one in need. 
Although I seldom die doin it, it would be glorious and honorable 
both....wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Please ‘scuse any errors in this memoir. Not bein too able to read or
write I had to rely on others ta transcribe it fer me.</p>

<p>Finally, Tis me pledge as a Warrior Weaponmaster, Guild Master, Master of 
Voln, and member of the Clan Faleen, ta each an ever one of yas, that I shall 
lend me aid whenever ya needs a strong arm by yer side. All ya gots ta do is 
holler. If I be in range, I’ll come a runnin.</p>
