<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3" color="#00FFFF">Exorr’s
father was an elf. He lived his life in the wilderness. He spent his time
learning about everything around him. He was a master locksmith. You could often
find him searching the furthest corners of the forest for chests that pirates
and adventurers had left behind.</p>

<p>Exorr’s mother was a wolf. She spent her days stalking through 
the night looking for food and companionship. She was someone that always kept to 
herself. All other races looked down upon her because she was not one that walked 
on two legs like everyone else. Having to deal with rejection all the time she 
had a very strong will. She enjoyed being with her pack but loved being alone at 
night and always left the pack when the sun set.</p>

<p>The two of them met one night while Exorr’s father was sleeping 
on top of a boulder. Exorr’s mother smelled his scent and decided to investigate. 
That night the forest was bathed in a light that came from the full moon in the 
sky. This moon was a very special happening that only occurs once every 850 years. 
Under this moon no being has a form, just their spirit’s can be seen. Neither of 
them knew about this occurrence. When Exorr's mother found his father that night 
on the boulder she fell in love with him instantly. Sensing something was 
different his father awoke to see the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Both 
spirits glowed in the moonlight. They inched closer to each other cautiously as 
neither one of them knew exactly what the other was. The closer they became the 
greater the love between them grew. The two spirits connected and merged into one, 
thus Exorr was conceived.</p>

<p>When they awoke the next morning and saw each other for the 
"first time" neither of them could believe it. They where afraid having always 
been taught and learned to hate beings of other races. However, remembering the 
night prior, they both decided they wanted to spend the rest of their lives 
together no matter how is would look to the rest of there families. Sometimes 
love is so strong that nothing can keep it apart, this was the case for Exorr’s 
parents.</p>

<p>Exorr was born 5 months and 3 days after that night. His 
parents gave him the family name Y’ngblood because they knew if he was given 
either of they’re two last names he would be hated by all elves and wolves. They 
decided upon Y’ngblood because Exorr was the first with the name, which gave him 
the youngest and oldest blood in the family.</p>

<p>Exorr’s mother taught him how to hunt with stealth. She taught 
him never to kill any wolves or elves and to always help the suffering. Exorr’s 
father taught him how to become a master locksmith and told him that it would 
take him a long time to achieve that rank. Both his parents taught him how to 
hide in the shadows and to stalk people so he could not be detected. They taught 
him to only steal from those that could spare it and never from the young.</p>

<p>Exorr’s mother passed away when he was only 17 years old. Exorr 
grieved for months after her death, not wanting to believe she was dead. His 
father allowed him to grieve; knowing it was the only way that he would be able 
to accept what had happened. Exorr promised his mother he would always live by her 
words and never forget her face and the love he felt for her.</p>

<p>Eight years later Exorr’s father passed away from a great 
illness. Exorr did not know what to do without his mother or father around. He 
knew that if he went to the wolves they would not accept him because he was 
half-elf, and he knew that the elves wouldn’t accept him because he was also 
half-wolf.</p>

<p>Exorr decided that he would leave the forest he knew as his home 
and search other parts of the world. Before he left his home he promised his 
mother and father he would never forget their faces, the advice they had given 
him, and the great love he felt each time he thought about them.</p>

<p>Exorr left his home six months after his father passed away. He 
explored many places but could never find one that he fancied. One day, while on 
a search for food, Exorr came across an old warrior. The warrior told him that 
there was a city just over the mountains to the east, he also told Exorr that 
once he had explored the city that he should leave the city through the west gate 
and go northwest until he found a courtyard and that he would know what to do 
once he got there. Exorr didn’t know if he could believe the old warrior but 
decided he had to investigate for himself.</p>

<p>The next day Exorr was at the top of the mountains, when he 
looked down he could hardly believe what he saw. There must have been at least 
two hundred people bustling about their business, these people where of all 
different races. Exorr knew he had found his new home and that he would not be 
looked down upon because of his race.</p>

<p>Exorr made many friends his first year in this city. He had 
joined a society called Voln that sought after freeing the undead from their 
torture. Exorr knew his parents would be proud of him for all that he had become.</p>

<p>One day while Exorr was picking some boxes for the locals a 
little girl looked at him and asked her mother who the wolfman was? Her mother 
told her that it wasn’t kind to say such things about people. Exorr told the 
little girl and her mother that he didn’t mind being called the wolfman, he 
actually liked the sound of it. From that day on Exorr has been known as "The 
Wolfman" to his closest friends and some of the community.</p>

<p>After a year in the city of Wehnimers Landing Exorr had grown 
tired of what it was becoming. Many of the new people arriving in the city where 
rude to Exorr and his friends. Then the word got to them that there was a new 
city being opened called Solhaven. Exorr and his friends decided to make that 
city they’re new home. While in Solhaven Exorr met a young girl named Marylee who 
didn’t seem to know anyone around the city. When Exorr asked her who her parents 
where she said she didn’t have any and asked him if he would be her father. Exorr 
was very shocked at this question and didn’t know how to respond. He thought 
about it and decided that it would be good for him to have a daughter and that 
this girl needed a parent so he adopted Marylee and has loved her as his daughter
ever since.</p>

<p>Exorr has met many great friends in Wehnimers and Solhaven and 
loves them and their company. He is part of a family, Clan Faleen, that treats 
him like he’s a brother. Exorr has been in Wehnimers and Solhaven for almost two 
years but has begun to grow restless. He has begun to think that he will once 
again set out on a journey to find a new home. However, he will stay in Solhaven 
until the voices of his parents tell him he must move on....</p></font></center>
