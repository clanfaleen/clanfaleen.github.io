Well let's see, my name is Wholie Wyndflamme, There isn't much to say about me, 
I'm an orphan, well I was, but I'll get to that. I was born and raised around 
the town of Wehnimer's Landing. You want to know what I did when I was younger, 
for those that know me and they will believe me. I played. That's it, I don't 
remember anything bad happening while I was growing up, except for an invasion 
or two, but I was stuffed away in the barracks when those happened so I couldn't 
tell you much about them.</p>

<p>When I turned twenty I was on my own. I didn't really know what I wanted to 
do so I got a job with the city clerk. I was delivering a message to the gypsy 
and I found her in the town square and there were several people casting spells. 
Spells always fascinated me and that was when I decided what I'd like to be. I 
went out in search of the mystic, what a mistake that was! Well anyway, that's 
another story.</p>

<p>I had just celebrated my fifth train when I heard of an adoption agency, so I 
applied and two weeks later I met my father, Vulkun for the first time. To say I 
was nervous is a gross understatement, but all went well and Vulkun decided to 
have me as his own. I met my Mom, Annilyssa the very next day. From that day 
forward my family expanded and expanded. Mom and Dad were very busy. Well okay I 
have a lot of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, Mom and Dad weren't THAT 
busy.</p>

<p>On about my seventh train I met a fellow named Arakion Hauk, to say he stole 
my heart, well you gals know what I'm saying. We had talked about marriage a few 
times but he was hesitant. We were walking in town and we met up with my 
Grandfather Sirke. We sat down and chatted for a while and one thing lead to 
another and the subject of marriage came up. I told Grandfather I wanted to 
married Arakion, but we needed a cleric and wouldn't you know, Uncle Warrezzer 
walked up to us at just that moment! Arakion was getting extremely nervous so I 
gave him a flask I found on the benches in the square. Arakion was calming him 
self down while Grandfather was telling Uncle Warre what was going on. Uncle 
Warre looked at me and asked if I wanted to marry Arakion, of coarse I said I do. 
Then Uncle Warre looked at Arakion and asked him if he wanted to marry me, 
Arakion was beside himself so he took another sallow of his flask. He looked a 
little green so Grandfather gave him a good swat on his back which put Arakion 
into a coughing fit and he was nodding is head. Grandfather took that as a yes 
and told Uncle Warre that of coarse Arakion did! Uncle Warre then pronounced us 
Man and Wife! I think my wedding was the shortest in history, can I be proud of 
that?</p>

<p>I was moving along quite nicely in my training when I realized that the mystic 
gave me the worst advice. Never ask the mystic for advice or you'll be starting 
your training over just like me. I'm doing good, it's a little easier this time 
around, which is good, because I was having a lot of problems mastering spells 
before.</p>

<p>Where will I be in the future, that I can't tell you, but I can tell you that 
I'm glad I join Clan Faleen, Clan of the Raven It's a lot of work, but it's fun. 
I learn something new everyday and I enjoy my life in Wehnimer's. I just wish 
Father, Mother and Grandfather Sirke hadn't gone on their quests, I miss them 
terribly.</p>
