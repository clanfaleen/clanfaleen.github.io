<center><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">Trenmarc lived in a small remote 
Faleen village. His Father was a historian and mother a seamstress/weaver. Trenmarc 
was in business with his brother, both were trappers/fur traders. Trenmarc was 
married to Serian, a girl that had been apprenticed to his mother. Life was simple 
and for the most part uneventful.</p>

<p>Checking his trap lines one evening, Trenmarc witnessed a group of golden 
armored soldiers mounted on horses and large griffins. As he watched the regiment 
heading south in a hurry, battered and tired, he couldn’t help but wonder at their 
purpose in his small lands. He had heard stories of golden warriors known as the 
Order of the Golden Scale. He had also heard tales of the present fight they had 
taken on against the Blue One’s armies. Curious as to the reasoning of their 
presence here, he quickly gathered his spoils for the day and hurried back to tell 
his loved ones of his wondrous sightings.</p>

<p>Upon nearing his village he soon saw clouds of smoke where there should be a 
village. Dropping his gear, and fearing the worst, Trenmarc ran as fast as his feet 
could carry him through the trails. He arrives at the entrance of his village in 
what seemed to take a lifetime of running. Frantically he tries to find any signs 
of his friends, family, anyone... only to find that he is the last survivor. He 
realizes to his dismay that this is from where the army had retreated. The Great 
Golden Army had been defeated trying to save his village. The grounds are littered 
with the bodies of mostly orcs and undead creatures of various evil creation. 
Battling his way through the few straggling beasts that were picking through the 
village spoils, Trenmarc finally finds the charred remains of what he believes to 
be his family. He marks a small shrine for his loved ones, lowering each of their 
bodies back into the arms of the earth that bore them. He spends a great deal of 
his time taking care to bury the remains of many of the other villagers he finds 
strewn about. He mournfully cradles a glowing stone that he found clenched in the 
partially charred hand of his wife Serian. The glowing nature of the stone 
beckoning to him as if to say that her very soul rest within it yearning for his 
comforts. He gingerly places the stone in a pocket close to his heart, the only 
reminder of his innocent love.</p>

<p>After all was taken care of he gathered his meager possessions and headed 
south, following the trail of the Order of the Golden Scale. Finding the 
headquarters, he enters their ranks and begins his training. After many moons, 
the former fur trader becomes an accomplished swordsman. He fights as one of the 
Order for 3 years before the battle that decided his fate. The Order had fallen 
back to the Benefactor's Capital, their numbers depleted, they find themselves 
gravely overmatched. In an effort to preserve their names sake, the leaders 
decide that 50 of their number would escape while the others would fight to the 
end. Thus, gods willing, those that escaped would be able to carry on in the hope 
defending the lands another day. Lots were drawn to decide the fates of each of 
the faithful warriors. Trenmarc found himself to become one of these favored by 
the gods. These 50 regretfully retreated, all to well knowing the fate of those 
whom stood to guard their escape. These 50 came to be known as "Seekers". Their 
duty, to find the remnants of the Clans that had made it to other towns and 
prepare them to stand and face evil of the Blue One’s armies once again and 
reclaim their homelands. As he makes his way out of the battle, to start his 
desperate journey, Trenmarc is stopped by one of his close brethren. Removing his 
griffin engraved bracers he hands them to Trenmarc. No words are passed, there is 
no need. This will be the last time they will see each other, as the golden 
warrior stands to protect the path that his friend (Trenmarc) must evade too. 
With a nod and a warm smile, the warrior nudges Trenmarc toward the escape route. 
Then the smile straightens, his eyes narrow, the bloodied golden armor dented and 
damaged... he turns to face the army that all to soon is cutting through his 
falling comrades. Like a bright shining statue of the gods he stands there 
blocking the path as Trenmarc makes his way, already out of sight. Trenmarc can 
hear his friends all too familiar war cries, and just when he thinks it is over 
he still hears his cries over the sounds of the battles, until he is so far away 
he can no longer hear the battle. Smiling to himself, he thinks," Give them hell 
for me my friend."</p>

<p>Trenmarc traveled much of the lands. Searching frantically for parts of his 
past and Order lost. He did eventually finding one such group in Elanthia, where 
he has settled, and since started his own clan Faleen also.</p></font></center>
