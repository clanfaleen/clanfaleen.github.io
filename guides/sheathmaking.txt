Sheath Making


Step One

First thing you need to do is find out how many units of animal hide 
you need for your sheath by measuring the weapon you're making a 
sheath for. Using a marked cord measure your arm, the standard size 
for a sheath is 30 units.

Step Two

Once you have your hides, you cut as many units as you need for your 
weapon sheath. There are three patterns: scabbard, sheath and weapon 
sling. 


WTRICK SHEATHM CUT <# units> <pattern>

---------------------------------------------------------------

Step Three

After you have enough hides cut for your pattern, you have to cure it,
so it will be durable. Use a portable wooden rack to stretch your 
hides. After you stretch the pattern on the racks, coat the non-furry 
side with the curative. 

The curative costs 50 silver per unit of hide.

Step Four

When the pattern has dried, you sew  it together with some leather 
threading. The thread costs 5 silver for every 4 animal hides.

The sheath is now made, but you may want to add more details... 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Step Five

You can stamp your initials in the hide... 


WTRICK SHEATHM INITIAL
For sheaths and scabbards, you can  add a strap to wear it on your 
belt, over your shoulder, on your wrist or on your ankle. Adding a 
shoulder, wrist or ankle strap is counted as one of the extras you can 
add to your sheath. Weapon sling patterns include a shoulder strap so 
one does not have to be added. 

Also, you can only attach wrist straps to sheathes or scabbards made 
with 4 hides, and ankle straps with 8 or less hides. Only smaller 
weapons will be able to fit in these types of sheaths, i.e. daggers 
& knives. 

Belts cost 50 silver, shoulder straps cost 100 silver.
Wrist and ankle straps cost 25 silver.

Step Six

Next, you can add one of the four  following extras:
inlaid jewels, fringe, metal binding, or you can dye your sheath. 

You can also attach jewels that you supply.
The fixtures cost 50 silver each, and you'll need at least 6 for them 
to be noticable on your sheath.

Not all gems are can be used on a sheath. You will have to use trial 
and error to find a suitable gem that you like. 


WTRICK SHEATHM INLAY
If you like a more fierce look to your sheath, you can add a fringe 
of claws, teeth, talons, feathers or bones. You'll need six of these 
items for the fringe to be noticable and the six fixtures will cost 
300 silver. 


WTRICK SHEATHM FRINGE
Binding your sheath with metal adds to its strength,
and adds a decorative touch. There is copper, which costs 2 silver per 
unit; brass for 10, silver for 50, gold for 100, mithril for 140, ora 
for 160, alum for 200, vultite for 300 and veniom for 1800. 


WTRICK SHEATHM BIND <metal>
Adding dye obscures what kind of hide you used
The hide will look like ordinary dyed leather. I.E. A puma hide sheath 
when dyed with midnight black dye will become a midnight black sheath. 


The dye costs 50 silvers per unit. Dying hides take time to dry. 


WTRICK SHEATHM DYE <color>
<color> the dye color/description can be 1 or 2 words, i.e. black or 
midnight black.
