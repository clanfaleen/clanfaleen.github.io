<title>Summer Soiree Story Telling Contest</title>
</head>

<body background="pics/back3l04.gif">

<p>On Restday, 1st of Koaratos at 18:00 Elven Stadard time of the year 5101 (Sunday July 1st at 6pm EST 2001) Clan Faleen held a story telling contest. This is the log Edited by Lady Cerridween of the event. This event was part of the Summer Soiree where many houses and a few "unofficial" groups got together and celebrated the coming of summer. The Soiree was kicked off with a parade then over the weekend events were held.
</p><p>
A note from Cerridween:  The contest was on the roof of the west tower and lasted about 2 hours from the time I explained rules till I got the stick back. The judges were Lady Talabrie (Herald of our clan at the time) Shirv (Finace officer at the time) Enkai (Fledgling at the time) and myself, Cerridween (Magistrate of the clan) We didn't all say our own stories but rather I started the story and each person had 5 minutes to add to it. It was an idea that came to me to use in GS3 because at sleepover I attended as a child we used to have "pass the stick" scary story nights. It was a blast! It worked in GS3 better than I had ever dreamed. I'd liked to thank everyone who showed up for the event. Without further ado: The Story.
</p><p>
(The top three prizes for winning were 100k, 70k and 40k notes in addition to a free altering. At this time the only one of those three winners that I'v heard back from after his alter is Drakkalan. He got "a shimmering sapphire blue greatcloak with a waterfall embroidered in subtle shifting colors" which looks very lovely if you ask me! The other two winners were Kavyn and Proximul.)

Cerridween says, "It is the time of summer, winter is gone and spring has brought beautiful flowers. Traveling Elanthia is a group of adventurers, each out in the world for their own prize. A tiny halfling waggler leads the group follows by his friends."
</p><p>
Cerridween says, "They decide to rest at the local in, but a surprise lurks there for them. While they are ordering their drinks a stranger comes up to them and offers t obuy them a drink. By the look of it, he is a giantkin. He begins to tell them of the quest he's been on. He says there are many perils and terrors along the way but offers much gold and fame."
</p><p>
Ghrom accepts Cerridween's wooden stick.
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "The stranger does not give his name, but does give this clue... "you may wish to seek the gold yerself lads," as he turns to Bess, the group's lone female he adds, "er, and Lass."  Blushing, he continues drinking."
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "Having their fill of the talk of this drunken giant, the group retires for the evening to the inn."
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "on the next day, they muster together to discuss the last night's conversation."
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "The leader, a mage of some renown, casts his vote for moving the group to the Illoke Stronghold - having heard there are mystics and shaman there of great power.  "We can gather our force there and learn the secrets of their magic.. and perhaps then..""
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "Yes, yes', interrupted the group's warrior, "whatever."  Let's just move straight to the gold!  "Egads, we need new supplies and such, you know that!""
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "Well, interjected Dawnel, the brave band's empath, "we surely could use some supplies but I think he's right, further magical power could serve us well if that giant is right about the perils we face..""
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "As the day passed, and they sold their furs and whatnot, the group deliberated.  Fiercely they debated the next step, over dinner.  Little did they know, however, what awaited them.."
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "for the giantkin, in much haste, arrived back at their table that night.."
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "bleeding profusely, the stranger managed to rasp out these final words, "beware brave folk!  I did not know, I did not.. I swear it.." as his final breath escaped him, he fell.. and a scroll rolled loose from his hand."
</p><p>
Ghrom says, "the group sat shocked.. til finally they Bess picked up the scroll and..."
</p><p>
Ghrom offers Eledryn a wooden stick. 
</p><p>
Eledryn says, "Bess, being a sorceress and having knowledge of how to read the arcane, studied the scroll for several moments, apparently indifferent to the giant's death."
</p><p>
Eledryn says, "Despite her knowledge, she was unable to decipher the cryptic runes written upon the scroll. Written in a dark brown that looked rather familiar."
</p><p>
Eledryn says, "The halfling mage examined the scroll himself, but was unable to learn anything useful. Except for a brief, passing mention of the legendary wizard named Melgorehn."
</p><p>
Eledryn says, "'What could it mean?' he wondered. Melgorehn was known for a more than a few things... the creator of the Floating Disk spell, not to mention the mountain with the familiar charging altar. And, as ancient lore has it, at least one artifact was permanently lost in the creation of that mountain."
</p><p>
Eledryn says, "So, left to ponder over this mention of Melgorehn..."
</p><p>
Eledryn offers Proximul a wooden stick
</p><p>
Proximul says, "The group studied the scroll for a few more minutes, pondering over their ale"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "Bess and Tarhel, the mage, discussed quietly over what else they could find on the scroll, when Dav, the groups warrior pounded his fist on the table"
</p><p>
Proximul says, ""Let me shee the shcroll!' he slurred in a drunken stupoer"
</p><p>Proximul says, "stupor"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "Dav reached for the scroll as Bess and Tarhel instinctively both pulled away, each holding half the scroll"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "::Rrrrip!:: the scroll tore in half"
</p><p> 
Proximul says, "The inn was suddenly filled with a horrible wailing sound, seeming to come from the depths of the underworld"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "Frowning, Tarhel put Dav to sleep and ordered one of the barmaids to put him to bed"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "As the warrior slept off his drunkenness, the remaining three discussed what this could mean"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "Finally at the late hours of the night they decided the best way to go was to check out the stronghold, for as Tarhel said before, powerful magicks were at work there and could possibly hold an answer to this scroll"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "They slept the rest of the night and woke up early the next morning, ready to travel"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "The four set out south to the stronghold, Dav slightly back, holding his head"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "As the group reached the halfway point and set down to rest, they were all suddenly filled with an awful sense of foreboding"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "A black mist filled the area and a dark shape loomed in front of them"
</p><p>
Proximul says, ""Turn back....turn back... before it's too late for all of you"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "the figure said"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "with a loud thunderclap, the figure was gone"
</p><p>
Proximul says, "they pondered what to do..."
</p><p>
Proximul offers Klaatu a wooden stick.
</p><p>
Klaatu says, "the four of them were each of a different mind. Tarhel seemed obsessed over the magics to the south."
</p><p>
Klaatu says, "Dawnel still felt a lingering guilt for not healing that poor Giantkin that set them on this quest"
</p><p>
Klaatu says, "Dav, furious over the mages working him so merely wanted to kill, anything, soon. While Bess was distracted by the warning, and her odd attraction to the warrior."
</p><p>
Klaatu says, "suddenly they all loooked up and turned their heads southwards as war horns echoed from the forest"
</p><p>
Klaatu says, "and a distant chant could be heard, as of many voices raised in worship. but the words they chanted were not to some benevolent god, but to something which should never walk this world"
</p><p>
Klaatu offers Creme a wooden stick.
</p><p>
Creme says, "the tiny band turned away from the strange chants and headed in the opposite direction"
</p><p>
Creme says, "the tiny halfling having in mind that he knew of an ancient mage who might be able to decifer the strange writings on the scroll"
</p><p>
Creme says, "but being a halfling and more concerned with tarts than scroll writings he decided to stop at the inn on the way thru and get a snack"

</p><p>
Myndelan says, "As she sat she slyly began to untie the rest of the adventurers"
</p><p>
Myndelan says, "With a moment of preparation Tarhel managed to cast invisibility upon himself"
</p><p>
Myndelan says, "Tarhel crept slowly closer to the band of Rogues who were still pawing among items and fighting over ownership"
</p><p>
Myndelan says, "Swiftly upon each of the Rogues he managed a swift webbing"
</p><p>

</p><p>
Nefertiria says, "She didn't chastise the man however, and instead grinned slyly and nodded for them to catch up with the others."
</p><p>
Nefertiria says, "The two quickly caught up to the others, and as the group was about to turn the way the wizard wanted, that strange and ominous chanting began again."
</p><p>
Nefertiria says, "The wizard, once again tried to lead the party away, but Dav and Bess would have none of that as they prepared for combat."

</p><p>
Spaewife says, "with that logic the group agreed and decided that the best was to proceed with caution on their original plan.  Quietly they traversed the edge of the forest and climbe the rocks to the cave of he aged mage... Entering they found the Elder and one other a very elderly but spry..... "
</p><p>
Spaewife offers Dymit a wooden stick.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Dymit says, "she began summoning powers unkonwn and never seen before"
</p><p>
Dymit says, "a golden aura shown about her"
</p><p>
Dymit says, "as you can see the power pulsating from her"
</p><p>
Dymit says, "the halfing ran hobbled forward as fast as he could"
</p><p>
Dymit says, "Wait! he shouted"
</p><p>
Dymit says, "we have come to see the elderly mage"
</p><p>
Dymit says, "he is a friend of mine from years past and i know him well"
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>
Violila says, "the mage slowly got up. He left the room, seeming discusted. The Warrior. Seemed a little anry. A small vein was throbbing in his neck"

</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>
Drakkalan says, "Dav announced that Bess had gone home"
</p><p>
Drakkalan says, "the group stared at him in disbelief, but as one of them went to question the warrior..his glare quickly silenced an doubts"
</p><p>
Drakkalan says, "they decided to trek onward"
</p><p>
Drakkalan says, "Continuing on their journey to find the meaning of the scroll, the group ventured into the side of a jagged mountain range- into the caverns below. A series of winding tunnels presented themselves, and left the group to discuss the best way to take. After some consideration, they chose the widest of the tunnles which appeared to be the main route."
</p><p>
Drakkalan says, "Lying in ambush, a band of lizard riding dark elves hovered above the adventures, and followed their progress through the twsiting maze, waiting for the most oppurtune moment to strike."
</p><p>
Drakkalan says, "And then they did. "
</p><p>

Drakkalan coughs.
</pre><p>
Drakkalan says, "Amidst the fray, the group's cleric, Breunor, dropped to one knee and cradled the head of Dawnell in his hands. He checked her pulse, sighing a breath of relief as he realized that her heart still beat. Although he realized that the beats were very slow, and continueing to slow every second."
</p><p>
Drakkalan says, "Quickly the dwarven cleric pulled a flask from his pack, and poured the health restoring potion into the poisoned empaths mouth. Dawnell's heart rate once again turned to normal."
</p><p>
Drakkalan says, "Tasting what he thought to be another sweet victory, Dav began to search for any retreating dark elves. A faint hissing noise came from the nearby cavern, but Dav's thirst for blood overcame his better judgement, and he ran on after 2 fleeing dark elves."
</p><p>
**for the sake of cutting stuff short, at this time everyone began to wonder where that clerics came from, heh heh**
</p><p>
Drakkalan says, "'Tarhell who was keenly aware of surroundings, also heard the noise, and yelled for the stubborn warrior to halt. But, Dav would not be deterred."
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>
Gahdy says, "finishing off the attackers one at a time the group retreated to the cliffs to decide where their next means of getting to the shaman was"
</p><p>
Gahdy says, "continuing the climb up the mountain, again the chanting followed them into the cracks  and crevices"
</p><p>

</p><pre>
Violila giggles.
Enkai shivers.
Violila gulps.
</pre><p>

</p><p>
Kavyn says, "as Bess came clambering over the ridge, trailing..  well.. Dav??  she smirked at the group"
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "before they advanced further obviously something had to be discussed, so they set camp after dispatching the druid"
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Certainly, they thought, there was a way out of this.  Together again, they rationalized the pros and cons of it all.  "
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "'Obviously some would have to scout ahead.  Tarhel and Dav immediately rose and began making preparations to do just that.  There was little argument in fact, and the two set off quickly."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Bess and Dawnel chose to pass the time reading passages from the Book of Fauna, a wonderfully delightful tome encompassing the life and times of many animals in the known realm."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Chanting broke their reading.  A dark, foreboding.. almost overpowering sense of evil overcame the camp.  Dawnel, obviously not the most accomplished weapon wielder, drew his dagger.  Bess prepped a spell and cast upon Dawnel - what meager protection she might provide could be the difference.  As the chanting became louder and louder, they both knew the time for waiting had ended."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Suddenly a pack of hounds were upon them, eyes glowing fire red and sulphur coming from their maws.  Wave upon wave they came.. slashing, biting, clawing.  Rending the two for what seemed an eternity.  As  first Bess, then Dawnel crumpled to the ground, a maddening cackle arose and the wolves ran back into the darkenss."
</p><pre>
Gahdy flails her arms about.
Mirsen gasps.
Cerridween winces.
Glayvin cringes.
</pre><p>
Kavyn says, "Dawnel arose, seeing Bess was far beyond hope.  He meditated over Bess' wounds, praying beyond hope that he could save her.  He'd never confessed his love for her and doubted anyone even knew.  Well, of course.. Tarhel knew.  "He knew everything thought Dawnel as he continued to feverishly bandage her wounds."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "as her bandages loosened and she began bleeding again, Bess leaned toward Dawnel and whispered, "please, my dear friend..."  She coughed up blood and continued, "could you...  tell Dav."  Her voice a mere whisper upon the wind.. "I .. lov..."  and she fell dead in Dawnel's arms.  "
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Torn from grief over his lost love and the emotions of jealousy he felt over Dav, he lowered her body gently to the ground.  Knowing full well that they'd not had time recently to turn to Lorminstra's graces for deeds, he only hoped that the Goddess would grant one last favor to his love."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Dawnel administered his last drop of life keep to Bess and placed her arms in a comfortable position, of course that only mattered to his own sense of concern.  "
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "As Dawnel knelt to pray, he was overcome with fear.  He rose up and searched the edges of his vision for intrusion and found nothing.  "
</p><pre>
Cerridween gasps in terrified panic, trembling and flailing her arms about!
Kavyn nods to Cerridween.
</pre><p>
Kavyn says, "The rest of the group finally arrived back, shocked to see what had become of their "camp."  "what happen'd 'ere!!?" screeched Dav, who immediately drew his weapon and set his shield.  Prepared for a fight, Dav took up position."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Tarhel, ever the level headed one, knelt to see the problem with Bess.  He sighed deeply, casting a glance toward Dawnel.  "I'm sorry, I truly am..""
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Dawnel waved off the mage's sympathy, as if it would help him forget.  He walked gingerly over to Dav and tearfully, barely able to contain his emotions, he hugged the warrior tightly.  Dav, obviously aghast at being hugged, recoiled from the withered empath, pushing him away."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Glaring now, Dawnel pursed his lips and spoke very clearly, "Bess said to tell you she loved you.  It was the last thing from her mouth, although in Koar's name I haven't a clue what she ever saw in you!"  The empath strode.. no, stomped away."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Dav blinked.  He'd not realized she was dead.. finally dead at the least.  A lack of clerical assistance would surely see to that anyway he now realized.  Anger boomed through him like a torrent!  He screamed in rage, howling like a snert freshly limbless from Briars' attention!  "
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "'NOOOO!!," he belted out and just as suddenly, he crumpled to the ground, shaking horribly."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Tarhel sighed again, loudly.  "We must get her buried and move on if we're to finish our quest," he said as he rose to begin."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Dawnel nodded to the mage, moving to begin their morbid task. Dav slumped against a tree, his face pale.  Although his muscles would obviously help in their efforts to prepare the burial, it was clear he'd be of no use."
</p><p>
Kavyn says, "Just then..."
