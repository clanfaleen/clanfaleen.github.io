<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4"><b>The Brother's War</b></p>

<p>Gyryk and Sarok were twin brothers, rivalry between them was 
always strong from the time of their births. Gyryk was the first of the two to be
born, as the first born he would inherit all his parents wealth and belongings 
the most important of which was the families Manor and Keep. Throughout their 
lives Sarok held birth order as a slight against him by his brother. Gyryk from 
birth seemed to be a prodigy at several intellectual studies, while his brother 
always seemed to be a step behind in his studies. When they were thirteen it was 
time for advanced studies, the time of apprenticeships. Gyryk was accepted as a 
student by a well known and highly respected philosopher while Sarok could only 
find a librarian to accept him as apprentice.</p>

<p>Both their studies went well away from each other, Gyryk began 
to discover why things in the world worked the way they did, Sarok studied books 
and manuscripts thought to be lost by the general public. At 16 their father 
died, leaving Gyryk as the Keep's holder. Gyryk called his brother home shortly
after he became Keep Holder and granted half of the lands the family owned to
Sarok. Though half was well more than he was entitled too it was not enough for 
Sarok, in his eye's this granting of property to him was nothing more than Gyryk 
rubbing his nose in the fact he will never be more than the second child.</p>

<p>Gyryk began to study herbs as a way to heal something that had 
never been attempted, he had picked a supply of certain herbs he felt had a 
possibility of having a healing effect. He prepared a sample of an herb and 
channel some personal energy into it, I believe this personal energy is what you 
call mana. Though it didn't reveal any healing effects it definitely had an
unexpected effect, it is believed this first spell he discovered was a light
producing spells. On this day Gyryk became the first mage and took the name 
Truthseeker. He continued his studies with these, "components" and discovered 
many more that had effects when channeled into and he also began to combine 
components to get more amazing results. He divided the components and there 
effects into 6 categories of magic based on the elements, Earth, Wind, Water, 
Fire, Light, Dark. He believed that the ability to learn magic was hereditary and 
attempted to teach it to his brother, but his brother had little interest till he 
found out about the magic of the element Dark.</p>

<p>Truthseeker cautioned Sarok that the Dark magic should be 
controlled and not abused and said he would teach none of the Dark magic he had 
learned to Sarok because he intended to make it so none will even hold it. Sarok
again took his brother's actions as a personal slight against him and stole his
brother's notes concerning Dark magic and began to study them on his own, he
also discovered another set of elements his brother never did based on the
element of Death. On the day of this discovery Sarok took the name Deathbringer 
and vowed to bring death to his brother and any who would support him.</p>

<p>Deathbringer began to amass a large army of undead and demons, 
he sought others that were willing to serve him and that could learn to use magic. 
He sent this army against his brother at the families Keep hoping to have his
brother killed and have the keep and family property to himself, but his brother
and the few students he had, managed to repel the attack and even directed a 
counterattack. Truthseeker knew what his brother had done when the attack was made 
on the Keep, so he sent out word to the king asking for his support in eliminating
the evil his brother had brought into the world, he also sent out messengers to
other countries to seek aid and warn them about the menace.</p>

<p>Truthseeker began to forge a weapon that would be intelligent 
and able to find a way to defeat his brother without having to kill him. He named 
the blade "Seeker" and carried it with him to all battles he participated in 
hoping it would find a way to defeat his brother. The armies of both sides fought 
many battles but neither truly gained any ground until Deathbringer discovered a 
spell that allowed for the changing of a persons body into something else. 
Deathbringer set an ambush for his brother who was leading a small party to a 
meeting with a new ally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as Truthseeker came into view 
Deathbringer sprung his trap casting the new spell at his brother and changing him 
into a tree, the rest of the party was set upon by various undead as Deathbringer 
attempted to take &quot;Seeker&quot;, a few of Truthseeker's followers attempted 
to block Deathbringer so he used the spell on himself and changed himself into a 
large reptile called a velicioraptor, a extremely deadly form coupled with his 
magic ability he seemed unstoppable, a young mage who came from Clan Snar named, 
Timeron snatched the blade "Seeker" and fled as the others fought futilely against 
Deathbringer. He gave the blade one instruction, "Find me those that can defeat
Deathbringer anyway possible."</p>

<p>Within 6 months the blade had led him to many people whom all 
joined him in his cause, they came from varied professions and countries but were 
united in their cause. They caught Deathbringer by surprise alone at the Keep, 
during the fight he shifted to the velicioraptor form and managed to kill several 
of those against him before they managed to kill him. After the battle Timeron hid 
"Seeker" and used the Keep to set up a school for mages. Those that killed 
Deathbringer were honored and celebrated, but one by one they each died a 
mysterious death. Some said these death's were caused by Deathbringer's followers, 
other's said the evidence pointed to the fact that Deathbringer had somehow 
returned from the grave.</p>

<p>But that's a story for another time.</p>

<p>This is the story of how it was, remember and learn from it.</p>

<p><b>The Sisterhood</b></p>

<p>Fredi was a typical Macote youngster. But she was born with a 
gift, the gift to manipulate the forces of magic. She discovered her abilities 
when she was 6, but kept the little tricks she found to herself, until she was 12 
when she was caught starting a cook fire without the aid of flint.</p>

<p>The Clan Elders knew the dangers of an untrained person using 
the magical forces, so they ordered her sent to Askar to train her magical 
abilities at Timeron's school. Through her training she learned she was strongest 
in the elements of Fire and Wind and had enough ability to use Earth magic as 
well.</p>

<p>Her teachers found her to be tough to teach because of her 
unwillingness to do things exactly the way they showed, she always asked lots of 
questions as to why it must be done that way when you get a better effect doing 
another, twice she was almost thrown out of the school for showing a teacher that 
he or she was wrong when they said it can't be done that way.</p>

<p>In her last 5 years at the school she became friends with the 
schools guard captain Hylun. When Fredi graduated from the school and was 
returning home she invited Hylun to go with her, and she accepted.</p>

<p>Eventually the wanderlust got them and they started to travel, 
taking small mercenary type jobs as the went.</p>

<p>Hylun was born Hyluniaria Sintary Okian to parents that had 
wished for a boy to carry the name of her father's father, Hylun Sintar, a great 
Askari general. It is an Askari belief that if you name a child after a departed 
loved one the child would take on the characteristics of their namesake.</p>

<p>From birth her father talked to her about tactics and strategy, 
he taught her the strengths and weaknesses of calvary, archers, pikes, footmen 
etc. At 17 she entered the Askari military for the mandatory one and half year 
service that all citizens must serve. She was top in her training group and was 
soon made a junior officer. At the end of her term she signed on for 5 more years.
She worked her way up to Captain Commander before her term was up and she left 
the service to travel.</p>

<p>She went to the territory owned by the Clans as a mercenary, 
taken on guard assignments and other sword for hire type jobs. She returned to 
Askar after a few years because the jobs weren't challenging to her. Upon return 
to Askar her father told her of a mage school looking for a guard captain, this 
is the same school founded by Timeron after the Brother's war. She took the job 
and eventually met a young Mage by the name of Fredi a member of the Clan Macote,
they became close friends.</p>

<p>When Fredi had learned all she could Hylun returned to the 
ClanHold Macote with her. Both of them soon felt the need to wander, neither were 
the type of person that can sit in one spot for a long time. They soon met a 
beastmaster named Tiana and began the Mercenary group known as the Sisterhood and 
began to seek others like them.</p>

<p>This is the Story Of Tiana, Beastmaster of the Clan of the 
Python. Tiana was raised by the Chief Elder of Xaran though she wasn't her child.
Tiana was an orphan found on the outskirts of the ClanHold, her true parents are 
not known but were believed to be hermits. As she grew it became evident that 
Tiana was special. Beasts from the surrounding wilds would wander into the 
ClanHold and sit near her, never causing her harm.</p>

<p>At first it alarmed the Clan members but when they realized 
none of the animals meant her harm they left them be. It wasn't until she was in 
her early teens that it was realized by the Clan members that she was somehow 
calling these animals to herself. That realization came when she was mad at a 
friend and told him that she wished the birds would pull his hair out which they 
did.</p>

<p>The Chief Elder knew she must find a teacher for Tiana. Beastmasters typically 
shun civilization, so it wasn’t an easy task but a teacher was found and taught 
Tiana to control her abilities. Tiana became a young woman, and wanted to use her 
abilities for the well being of people.</p>

<p>She met a couple of other women , Hylun of Askar, and Fredi of the Clan of the 
Bear. They had a desire to form a group of female adventurers. The three of them 
set out to find others who had talent and desire to help others, eventually 
forming a Mercenary group of all females called the Sisterhood.</p>

<p>In future tellings I will cover other members pasts there were 13 in number, 
covering all professions and varied races. Tiana was the First, their commanding 
officer.</p>

<p>This is the story of how it was, remember and learn from it.</p></font></center>
