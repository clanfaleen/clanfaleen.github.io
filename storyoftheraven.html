<p>This is the story of the Raven as told by the Bear Clan of the Native American 
red nations.</p>

<p>Raven...<br>
Black as pitch,<br>
Mystical as the moon,</p>

<p>Speak to me of magic,<br>
I will fly with you soon.</p>

<p>Throughout time, Raven has carried the medicine of magic. This had been true 
in many cultures across the planet. It is sacred, in the medicine ways, to honor 
Raven as the bringer of magic. If the magic is bad medicine, the carrier may be 
honored out of fear rather than out of respect. Those who fear Raven may do so 
because they have been dabbling in areas in which they had no knowledge, and a 
spell may have backfired on them. Rather than analyzing the dark side of sorcery, 
realize that you will fear Raven only if you need to learn about your inner fears 
or self-created demons.</p>

<p>Raven magic is powerful medicine that can give you the courage to enter the 
darkness of the void, which is the home of all that is not yet in form. The void 
is called the Great Mystery. Great Spirit lives inside the void and emerged from 
the Great Mystery. Raven is the messenger of the void. When Raven appears in you 
totem, you are about to experience a change in consciousness. This may involve 
walking inside the Great Mystery on another path at the edge of time. It would 
portend a signal brought by the Raven that says, "You have earned the right to 
see and experience a little more of life's magic." Raven's color is the color of 
the void -- the black hole in space that holds all the energy of the creative 
source.</p>

<p>In Native teachings the color black means many things, but it does not mean 
evil. Black can mean the seeking of answers, the void, or the road of the 
spiritual or nonphysical. The blur-black of Raven contains and iridescence that 
speaks of the magic of darkness, and the changeability of form and shape that 
brings and awakening in the process.</p>

<p>Raven is the guardian of ceremonial magic and in absentia healing. In any 
healing circle, Raven is present. Raven guides the magic of healing and the 
change in consciousness that will bring about a new reality and dispel "dis-ease" 
or illness. Raven brings in the new state of wellness from the Void of Great 
Mystery and the field of plenty.</p>

<p>Raven is the messenger that carries all energy flows of ceremonial magic 
between the ceremony itself and the intended destination. For instance, if a 
ceremony is being preformed to send energy to a disaster area where people need 
courage and strength, Raven would be the courier for that energy flow. The 
intention could be to allow the people of the devastated area to feel the concern 
and support of the participants in the ceremony.</p>

<p>If you have dreamt Raven, magic is in the air. Do not try to figure it out; 
you cannot. It is the power of the unknown at work, and something special is 
about to happen. The deeper mystery, however, is how you will respond to the 
sparkling synchronicity of this alchemical moment.</p>

<p>Remember, this magic moment came from the void of darkness, and the challenge 
is to bring it to light. In doing so you will have honored the magician within.</p>
